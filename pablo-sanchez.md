# Pablo Sanchez

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah, so I keep having issues trying to sign in. So I, I teach at Trent University here in Ontario. So I use it a lot. I've been really like the programme and I've been trying to use it to like review, like, you know, graduate student theses and things like that, like chapters. And so I was doing one of those, and it was working, okay, and I had my password kind of saved on my Mac computer. But then when it said to switch to the new, you know, new upgraded version, it did that, but then it just wouldn't let me sign in with won't let me sign it. And I don't even know what the password is at this point. Okay, one second. It should definitely be connected to polish German at Trent u.ca, though,

Jack Bowen: let's double check. Let me just

Pablo Sanchez: It's all indigenous studies rated. It's like First Nations people in Canada. So it's an Indigenous Studies PhD programme. So it's a lot of various topics, sometimes history sometimes, like current kind of issues or events or things that are happening. So it's a variety of different things. So we have a we have a monograph option on a project based option so they can, so it's largely I've reviewing like chapters of dissertations, or even like dissertation proposals on that sense.

Jack Bowen: Okay, interesting.

Pablo Sanchez: right. Okay, so I'll have to actually try to sign in. We'll see what Sorry, I was on VoiceThread.

Jack Bowen: What browser are you using there, oh it's Safari? Alright.

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah, I use I was using Safari initially too. So okay. So this is what happens. So obviously my thing is here. Let's see. Alright, get rid of that.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, that thing just below that.

Pablo Sanchez: Oh, this okay. So I do this. So it says So take me to the new app. Okay, click that. Well then I put my email address hen

Jack Bowen: Oh, that won't work. They'll just tell you they'll just make a new account. Okay, let's let me double check one thing let me see sometimes is your email provided by Google or something like Gmail

Pablo Sanchez: it's connected to Trent uses like Microsoft everything like so they use like I forget what the Google Base is it outlook they use Outlook and stuff.

Jack Bowen: Oh, yeah. Okay, well, let me just double check this right Yeah, looks like you

Pablo Sanchez: I even tried to reset the password several times and it kept saying it was emailing the password to me and I never received a thing to restore it

Jack Bowen: as usually if you I'm just looking at your account. It looks like

Pablo Sanchez: Probably, maybe like a year, a year, maybe a year and a half. Okay,

Jack Bowen: was there like a big break in between like oh no I can see Yeah, okay cool

Pablo Sanchez: because I think I tried it out briefly and then I just registered for it because it seemed really like something usable for my work

Jack Bowen: okay, you got to click Continue with Apple continue with the Apple yeah and then yeah it'll be password and that is not working together now. Oh just that they'll do I think they'll look fine yep, I just hit Continue see it's not you

Pablo Sanchez: so is there a way you can just reset my password so I can access it just by putting my email address in

Jack Bowen: thing is it's managed by Apple. So we can't reset that password for you've got to get Apple to do it but that's really bizarre that okay, so it looks like you might you might have made an Apple account with your Trent Trent you.ca email Do you want to go

Pablo Sanchez: I was asking Oh, okay. I thought it was asking for

Jack Bowen: Yeah. There you

Pablo Sanchez: see and this is what it brings me to though and I and I already know my account is active so it keeps like and that's what you were saying a minute ago that if I use Apple it would just like treat it like a new account which is what it seems to be doing now. Huh

Jack Bowen: migration

Pablo Sanchez: I already have like the education one account

Jack Bowen: this is really bizarre. Do you want to just hit refresh for me?

Pablo Sanchez: all right. Okay so what do I do now with this?

Jack Bowen: Um, did you open the link

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah, I believe I did

Jack Bowen: who just hit sign in with Apple Yes, I'm

Pablo Sanchez: Was like it's trying to make me create a new one. It does say if you have an account log.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. So

Pablo Sanchez: I think I tried this and then it told me already that I already had

Jack Bowen: out. Oh, interesting.

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah, I think it told me just just go with I'll just copy this just so I know what is your

Jack Bowen: email address? Oh,

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah, nothing.

Jack Bowen: Huh? Refresh the page one more time and then try it. If that doesn't work, well, I'll just what I can do is just give you a I can just give you a coupon so you can get into it in the meantime without paying again, and then we'll just fix it in the next couple of days and then just hit continue with Apple is it taking

Pablo Sanchez: Okay. Does that mean it was what I had in there though?

Jack Bowen: Yeah, you can actually migrate your old files in the moment anyway. But if you want to try it out and start using it, we've got that coming soon, but we haven't built it so you can like use the new app in the meantime and you can use like either the old or the new one but you the files that you make will only like with everything will get moved to the new one eventually, but we haven't we haven't fixed that up yet. Okay, um, would you want to let me just I can send you a coupon so you can just use free

Pablo Sanchez: All right, so log out of this than I or do I just leave this here

Jack Bowen: skewed aside

Pablo Sanchez: do I need to do the the academic thing though since I was on the academic one before

Jack Bowen: what I'm gonna do is just give you a coupon that we'll just do we'll just make it free and then you can just create an a new account you can just sign up again with this this email and you'll just be able to use it in the meantime but and then and then I'll just like so that the price won't they won't actually charge you I'll just give you like a

Pablo Sanchez: yeah, so weird because I wasn't having any issues with it honestly, until I clicked on the thing to migrate it to the new system and then it just would let me connect anymore

Jack Bowen: yeah, we've had a lot of problems with it it's

Pablo Sanchez: the pro one I have like this this academic one here all right.

Jack Bowen: So I'm just trying to find the right to fall here we have like a million of them in our back end um right off this sense each of 100 apply to a specific product that doesn't really matter duration ones customer facing code on and off number of times to create

Pablo Sanchez: Like 100 this way are spelled

Jack Bowen: out. Oh, like that. All capitals off all plans. One word?

Pablo Sanchez: Oh, one sec.

Jack Bowen: Oh, sorry. Sorry, take you to one

Pablo Sanchez: or nine. So I have a protection thing on my Visa card. So

Jack Bowen: okay, um, do you. So it sounds like you were basically quite overwhelmed by having to go through loads of undergrad papers. And yes, like actively looked for a solution to solve it. Which other ones? Did you come across? WhatsApp? Did you come across any any other tools? Like Were there other things that you tried using status?

Pablo Sanchez: Not? Well, I couldn't really find any other things like that were automated, in a sense, right? That did a first kind of, you know, run through of looking at the paper. Just because some of the, like one of my classes has, like 250 students in it like, so reading every single paper, it takes such a long time. And to be fair, you know, to make sure that you're kind of going through them. And I think it really does help to, you know, to kind of create an outline, and then you can kind of like it says, you can click in and kind of read the areas, and then you can kind of then click in and read more like, so I see where you can kind of make the connections back to the actual paper just from the outline of it. So that makes it much easier. Yeah, to to go through, and then you're looking for those main things. You've given them the assignment to do so. Yeah. Interesting.

Jack Bowen: Okay. And like, how, how often do you have to go through these papers? Like, is it is this sort of like something that happens once a year? Or is it like a kind of rolling basis that you have, you feel like, you've got a lot to read and get overwhelmed by?

Pablo Sanchez: Well, it's generally once a term because these are like half courses. So they're like, from run from like September to December, and then from like, January to April, that's how the courses are hearing in Ontario anyway, okay. At most of the universities, so we have various assignments to like so because I also have assignments running through VoiceThread. So obviously, that's a bit different. It's more, you know, more vocal kind of oops, thought, that wouldn't work so much for this, but

Jack Bowen: what's VoiceThread,

Pablo Sanchez: but we started really amazing, it actually allows. So you can actually, like if you're going to do a presentation like this, and you have like, you know, say on the screen right here, this was a PowerPoint, and you're like delivering it. So you can basically create a PowerPoint, you upload it to VoiceThread. And then you can Film yourself on your computer like right now like we're discussing, I could film myself speaking right now, and it would appear on VoiceThread. And then the students can actually reply to each slide using audio, video or text comments. So it creates more, it really is great and an online course environment because it creates more of a sense of a seminar, a smaller seminar, so Okay, yeah, works really well. So I have two online courses, undergrad courses that I do that works. This works really well for. Got it. And that. Yeah, so I think when I was first exploring the idea of using the software, this platform, I was looking at the undergrad, the options for undergrad classes. But then I was when I was really investigating it and reading up on it, it became really clear that this could be and I think someone had someone from Jamie had stated that it could be used for reviewing graduate theses and things like that. So I said, Oh, well, let me try that out. And so then I uploaded one and I could see where it did do that.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Okay. Yeah. So what? How to? Like, okay, how to put this,

Pablo Sanchez: I have actually, when I first came across that I sent it to one of the other graduate faculty and he has, like, I personally have 14 PhD students that I'm supervising in our programme, and that I'm, I'm supervising a couple of masters students and this person has, he probably has 30 or 40 students said he's supervising some hair at trumpet and other universities as well. Okay, so there was just as large, you know, and then you have a lot of undergrad teaching as well. So and then we're sometimes just on a bunch of different graduate committees as well. So it is really a lot of reading and, and so it's not like we don't want to read their dissertations or theses. But the idea is that this seemed and it seemed to work really well, in a sense that it it, it gave you a different way of actually reading it. So it was you can you can automate it and organise it in a way and they could just click on those things. And so then we're just going to understand, Okay, does does the proposal have these important things? Do they have a literature review to they have methods chapter? Do they have those things that they're supposed to have? And then you can just click on that. So I find it to be more, I think a more effective way of actually structuring your reading than just starting with page one and going through and reading to the end of it. Actually put notes on Each part of a you know, and then it makes it easier to refer back to the notes. And it made it possible to give students better notes to on their on their writing. Got it, I thought it was very helpful. So I did forward it to him and said, Hey, you should check this out. Because I think it's really, it looks like it would work really well for, like our needs in the in the Graduate Programme. So he was going to check it out. So I don't know if he if he actually enrolled in it or not. But

Jack Bowen: I suppose what I'm asking is like, um, you know, it sounds like you're making really good use of it. And I suppose my question is, like, where do I find more people like you, like, what sort of defines you as somebody that feels a burning need for a tool like ours?

Pablo Sanchez: Well, I'm always interested in like, all of the New Age kind of technologies, but I think a lot of other people are as well, like in a way of managing the workload. And, you know, also being more effective at reading, you know, the work that graduate students are producing, or even undergrad students in essence, like to make it more effective and how we're reading their their work. So that makes us more effective at giving them correct kind of feedback, too. Because if you're reading through the whole draft, and then tried to remember and going back and looking at different notes and a different place like this makes it where you can like, you can look at the actual dissertation, and then you can look at the automated kind of outline, and then your notes like so they're integrated in more of a way that I think is really effective. So I really liked it when I started messing around with it. So I was right in the middle of reviewing a student's proposal when I couldn't get access to it anymore, like so. And she's been Mellie duty proposal yet.

Jack Bowen: Oh, gosh, sorry. I think I think we got your message at about 9pm in the office. Okay, yeah, sorry about that. I'll be trying to be more responsive next time. Um, what? Like, okay, so it sounds like what you're you're kind of describing is like somebody who is like, trailblazing like, happy to try new tech, you know, wants to be more effective at like, reviewing documents and like managing workload on that level, like going through things and just kind of giving, like, really effective, effective feedback on on a sort of review process, I suppose for student your case. What, what, what doesn't work for you right now? Like, what, when? When does this go wrong? Like when when? Yeah, like, how does? How is Genie like falling short? The moment?

Pablo Sanchez: I don't know if I can even answer that. Because I think I would need more time to really make sure that I'm completely understanding how everything works. Like I was saying, I, I didn't realise before that you could actually click into, you know, that you could actually click into where the automated, you know, outline is, and that it would actually take you back to the actual place inside the document where that is, I didn't realise it actually could do that. Okay. So maybe if there was, what I felt would have been great, because I had to actually go in and look on YouTube and search other people who were using it to actually find that information, because I couldn't find it. I didn't see that anywhere in like the little tutorials or anything. So if there were some more effective tutorials, yeah, I also thought that if there was a way of really having some kind of tutorial for graduate students on how to use this to do there, because I saw that there was information about how grad students could use this to do their lit review, for instance, yeah. Because there are even comprehensive exams, because I was thinking of how this would have been useful for students who are studying for the comps, right, when there's like, 100 readings that they have to read. And like a term, you know, like, so this could really help them to and that kind of context to you know,

Jack Bowen: what? So these comprehensive readings, is this, like something that you specifically do in

Pablo Sanchez: our programme, like there's, so there's so many readings that they have to do, and they're divided up into four themes. So each theme has 17 different books or, you know, articles. So they have to read those and there is a comp course that's given to them in a second year. Okay. And then 30 readings they have to do the other 30 are based, really, it's kind of first kick at the can of their proposal literature review. Yeah. So it's still connected to the comps. But it actually gets gets actualized in their in their dissertation proposal. So I was thinking about how useful this would be for students to like in that sense. So I was thinking about how it could be useful in our programme for students and faculty for sure. So I was trying to really spend some time really understanding how it all works, so that I could then explain it to them. Yeah, get them really interested in doing it. It might be understood. I mean, it might be I don't know if this is worthwhile to you all, but it might be interesting to do if you were able to do some kind of workshop to show up you Apr, how it can be effective for them? I think that'd be great idea and probably other graduate programmes at Trent who would be interested in that.

Jack Bowen: I think that'd be I think that'd be really interesting. I think we'd be very, very awkward doing that. So, and yeah, I mean, I think I think it works will be fun. What? What do you the best ways of kind of setting that up? Like, how can we kind of make that happen? Like, maybe it'd be great, it'd be great to like, maybe talk to, I suppose, like, drill down a bit into, like, what's involved in that reading? And then like, maybe kind of develop a process within our tool where I could like, send you some videos or something we could kind of see. Yeah, see what you think. And whether it's sort of, you know, it's gonna work people are not

Pablo Sanchez: sure, like, and so there are, I mean, various graduate programmes here to some in the sciences, some in the humanities, some in the social sciences. So for Indigenous Studies, we work pretty closely with Canadian Studies. And, you know, we also have an Indigenous Environmental Studies programme as well, that's that there are a lot of students doing work in Connect to like climate change, and all these different kinds of things to Canadian Studies, like there's an Anthropology and History, ma hair. There's a lot of science based programmes, masters and PhDs, there's cultural studies, there's perform as like, so there's various different programmes, what might work is to see if some of the other graduate directors would be interested in coming to like, a workshop where you could talk about the ideas of what how this could benefit graduate students and how it could benefit faculty.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, absolutely. I be, I'd be, I'd be more than happy to like, put something together. If you want me to do like a little presentation or workshop or some slides or something I can, I can definitely, definitely put that together. Okay, should I send, I can send a follow up email, like a bit of a summary. Sure, that'd be great just describing and then maybe you can, I can send you something, maybe you could sort of forward a blurb on and just see if people are interested in if they I can put it together.

Pablo Sanchez: Okay, sure. That sounds great. And then, like, obviously, everyone's pretty used to using Zoom now because of COVID. Going away, so that could be a good way of doing it. So

Jack Bowen: yeah, absolutely. Okay, let me let me also in the follow up email after that, um, last question.

Pablo Sanchez: I don't know really, like,

Jack Bowen: like, what would be like, good to know, I suppose if, if we were like, if it were kind of, yeah, sort of the person building it like

Pablo Sanchez: that. I can't really think of anything, you know, I was just thinking, again, of the tutorials and things like that, that if they, if there was a bit more information, specifically with videos on how to do some of this stuff, it might be easier for to figure out like, like, for instance, like I said, I didn't know you could actually do that, like, so I was like, wow, that's really great. That'll be helpful.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Okay, more tutorials. We've actually got a page of them now. In in 1.0, I can show you let me send you a

Pablo Sanchez: Like, the problem is, this is always the issue for indigenous days that it falls in all of these categories. So

Jack Bowen: if you just hit other and just let you write Indigenous Studies in there, I think it should. Yeah. Sounds like a really interesting course.

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah, it is a really interesting programme like ours. University was the first university in Canada to have a PhD in Indigenous Studies. So

Jack Bowen: Wow. I went to the British Museum a few weeks back and they had some big gum. Like carved. I don't know if totem poles the right word from some Canadian tribes. That I think, you know, these big sort of carvings of like tree trunks that tell the story of the tribe.

Pablo Sanchez: Oh, yeah. Like Krabi. totems are like, yeah, totally.

Jack Bowen: That was it. Yeah. And that was one would like it had a big sort of, like a whale carved into something and then someone was like hunting the whale. And it was like, yeah, really, really quite.

Pablo Sanchez: Quite probably. That sounds like it's probably like West Kosta because a lot of most of the totems that you see were really created like on the West Coast and what is obviously now Canada but also the US like Washington state as well like,

Jack Bowen: oh yeah, it was kind of sad though I was reading the reading the little card attached to it and apparently the tribe who it belonged to, they all died out from some sort of disease and then they some collector like found it leaning against just kind of leaning against the shed somewhere in this sort of village and they bought it off the guy who had sort of found it previously where it's been abandoned, but well there

Pablo Sanchez: are Yeah, I don't know if that's accurate, but because there are a lot of there's lots of people indigenous peoples on the west coast that still do carvings.

Jack Bowen: Yeah

Pablo Sanchez: I think I did. I think I did do these tutorials, but

Jack Bowen: this is a I found it. I found the exact one. Sorry, this is such a tangent, but I thought it was quite interesting.

Pablo Sanchez: Oh, yeah, that's definitely West Coast stuff.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, it was one of these. Yeah, I saw the very as I

Pablo Sanchez: understand it, to these really reflects like the idea I'm, I'm actually initial Ave so I'm not from the West Coast. My people are here, and like Ontario and Quebec, but okay. This is really from what I understand about these, like, the history starts and it goes up, you know, in that sense. So yeah, that's I think the entire history of like, a whole entire, like extended family or region.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Just quite a lot of

Pablo Sanchez: them are really intricately painted to this one seems to not have sorry.

Jack Bowen: Oh, I think I think he'd said something about I think the paint might have come off or something maybe you're I think there's I think I remember something like that they Oh, perhaps it wasn't no never was in the first place but

Pablo Sanchez: it was like there's ravens two ravens are really big. See the Ravens here? They're really big and West Coast stuff. Oh, wow. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: The other one on the left eye that was the other one I saw that one has like a has like a boat sort of carved into it as well like I think it's around the other side. I just remember you but yeah, they were really young. Really quite quite stunning.

Pablo Sanchez: This one also seems to have a lot of birds as well. Oh, these are really cool. I've never seen these before. Obviously I I've always wanted to go to the UK but I haven't ever managed to get there.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Yeah, it's a it's a it's a really impressive collection of things they have there with a slightly

Pablo Sanchez: Oh, these are Haida that's it says here Haida. Okay. Yeah, Hydras pupils still exist. So these are from the 1850s That makes sense.

Jack Bowen: I should go and find out how they came to came to have it that I can't I there's something I can remember the story was they bought it off someone but I know it's a really interesting collection. But it's obviously got quite some cases quite a devious sort of history about how it sort of ended up in this museum.

Pablo Sanchez: Like they're definitely from they're from Haida Gwaii. Actually, some of these are from British Columbia. Yeah, they're from BC. Yeah. Theatre they're probably made from Red Cedar too.

Jack Bowen: So interesting.

Pablo Sanchez: It probably weren't brought back like it says are from the 1850s. So they probably were they probably were brought back in that period of time.

Jack Bowen: Do you think they stole them? Or was it just sort of

Pablo Sanchez: it's hard to to know they may have stolen them but they also may have been you know, maybe they bought them or sometimes they they would card these things too. And you know, sorry, my mouse just is moving back and forth. I do have to say that in the 1850s and NBC this is when this one British guy was trying to get this is before Canada's even a country legally right? For Confederation so it's in that period they were trying to get people to sign treaties so the only way that they got anyone to sign treaties and BC was that and this was on the one island there was a he went around shooting Canyon Ken cannon so he went around shooting cannons off his boat, his shot up at people to get them to sign

Jack Bowen: a riot really threaten them. Yeah. Because

Pablo Sanchez: BC otherwise other than Vancouver Island BC has no sign treaties. Okay, interesting. This it's this period in the 1850s that that happened there. Wow, I forget his name the guy who did it though?

Jack Bowen: Yeah

Pablo Sanchez: so these have definitely been treated says observation on them

Jack Bowen: yeah this is a yeah they've just sent you the link to it they got the picture of where they the the place where it was stored before they kind of brought it back

Pablo Sanchez: okay

Jack Bowen: Yeah.

Pablo Sanchez: Oh, wow. This has like a creation story on it. Wow. Yeah. See, I knew it had ravens on it.

Jack Bowen: I don't want to go back and look at it again. Actually.

Pablo Sanchez: Yeah. This one I doubt as much unless this is a newer conception because they didn't have money.

Jack Bowen: Oh, interesting.

Pablo Sanchez: But they like some indigenous communities did do gaming, but not the kind of gaming we think of like casinos and that kind of stuff that didn't do that kind of stuff. But that's interesting.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Wow. I'm sorry. I'm actually taking up loads of your time. I'm getting really deep into rabbit hole. I find this stuff quite interesting. As I'm sure you do. But yeah, let me crack on. But um, thank you for thank you your time and I have the IP funding you you product helpful. I'll send a follow up email, probably starting next week, and we can workshop and taking it from the

Pablo Sanchez: Okay, great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Awesome, Paul.

Jack Bowen: A pleasure to chat and yeah, hope to hear from you. Yes, sure. Awesome. All right, then. Bye bye.

Pablo Sanchez: All right. Bye for now.
