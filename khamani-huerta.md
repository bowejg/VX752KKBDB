# Khamani Huerta

Jack Bowen: Very good. Very good. Thanks for joining us.

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, no, sorry. I played it. Yeah. Just I was just out shopping and kind of slipped my mind.

Jack Bowen: Oh, no worries. I really appreciate you even taking the time out of your day to come and have a chat. Yeah, honestly, it means a lot.

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, not so good pizza. But now I was really excited to learn a bit more about it. Did you want me to bring it up and sort of gave up new ad easily do these things?

Jack Bowen: Um, yeah. I mean, if there's any, you want to share that, I mean, that'd be fantastic. I mean, like, basically what I'm interested in is just like, initial initial reaction to the new version, and then also more like kind of a couple conceptual questions around like, how you found us and like, how the problem manifests for you and what sort of things you're you're wanting to see Guess I'll just check that. It's kind of it looks like it's all black at the moment. Okay, let me do Shall I so to zoom like they'll be easier?

Khamani Huerta: No, much it's been my lighting in the differences,

Jack Bowen: sometimes Google says that Chrome does something weird where it blocks your camera still, nothing. Still nothing. Here. Let me let me send you zoom. Like I think normally that works. Kind of takes me some time to log in anyway. All right, you want to pop that open? Okay, cool. All right. And then okay, okay, so yeah I think you're on mute you're on mute. Oh, camera happens cool

Khamani Huerta: now Yeah, so the go Oh, yeah. So just sort of tell you a bit about what attracted me to it in the first place. I honestly can't remember exactly where I found it. I think it was probably on Facebook. But yeah, for me. So I am on Tony Moss, masters of organisational psychology.

Jack Bowen: Is that part time?

Khamani Huerta: I'm doing a part time. I'm in my fourth year of a two year degree. Then, I've been doing some work on the side and stuff and typically pretty much pretty much any job I've had is involved a shitload of reading. So I guess I struggle with attention. I've tried a few different apps have played around a bit with like speechify and, and that sort of thing just just stuck to me yet focused and just find that I'm not able to consume as much sort of quantity reading as I need to. So I tend to lead line on that stuff. So when when? Yeah, so when I came across this, and I probably came across it, like quite a while back. What happened about a year ago, that it came across, and I'm like, Ah, this is interesting. But I've never actually played around with it. Until like the reading genuinely piled up and I'm like, now I gotta do something about this.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Okay, um, okay. And so what's your, your, you're doing? What's your course or psychology? Organisational? Psychology, organisational psychology. Okay, got it. And and what do you do for work as well, alongside that?

Khamani Huerta: Some senior research specialist with a government agency, digital health, so yeah, it's the first government job I've had and they've got like, like security protocols and stuff that I never really had to work with before but the like, so when they gave me like this massive 50 page document Okay, that's that's why I had to go back and investigate and be like, Hey, I screwed up.

Jack Bowen: Security. I've spoken to Adrian, right co founder easy, like, kind of burned himself out. He was like, working straight. He's currently away. But he's back in a few days. I've asked him to, like, chase that and just make sure it's all completely deleted as soon as possible.

Khamani Huerta: But yeah, yeah, I guess somewhere along the line, it started developing an obsession with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and stuff. So when I started looking into that, and when you get into details on now, I was able to explain it to my manager in a way that was like, what swayed you don't have to worry about this. So I managed to avoid having to make a security report.

Jack Bowen: Oh, god, yeah.

Khamani Huerta: Appreciate the data that you gave him enough to work with to be able to go back and be like, it was we thought about this.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, no. Yeah, we Yeah, it will. Yeah, I'll make sure it's completely white. Nobody will, it won't get you through any training or anything.

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, no, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah, so I guess, in the short term, that, that I did play around with a foot, you know, what was, what was great about it was, you know, I had this really long document that I wasn't looking forward to reading. And then when I click Generate summary, I went in and everything was already broken down by sections and stuff. And like, the summaries were useful. The ones that that was not quite, that looks like them might have been sort of lacking nuance, or, you know, weren't quite on the mark. Or just go in and click on that and take me straight to the relevant section is like, oh, that's what I was talking about. Yeah. And I was able to sort of fill in the gaps in my understanding quite quickly. It just pulled out what was relevant to me based on how it had already broken it down for me. So I'm like, This is amazing. You should be using this all the time. Like, this is great.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Okay, that's good. And what was this document you were trying to read? Was that for work or study?

Khamani Huerta: That was for work. So it was, yeah, it was like meant to be an internal sort of discussion paper. That wasn't meant to be for public release. I thought it was a public release paper. But yeah.

Jack Bowen: And what what was the so with that kind of like, is that the only time you use it like any other kind of like, triggers to use it? You mentioned with your like, studying as well, you got a part of reading? Like, did you try putting some other things?

Khamani Huerta: I've learned assignment Julie's weekend, and I barely started. So I'm planning on dumping a whole bunch of stuff into this and saying, Yeah, okay, no, that should be quite handy. Quite often, I find, especially with the academic stuff. This is probably the wrong way. Like, usually, usually, how are you supposed to the door, if you're doing it the academic ways, you go, you search the literature, you let the literature sort of guide your thinking around, you know, like your, your opinion on something, not your opinion, but like, what the evidence base is, and then you make a claim based on the evidence and whatever, it's a report you're writing. Once you sort of across what's happening in the field, or you've kind of got a feel for probably what's going to happen anyway, or what sort of what direction the research might be leaning in, on my attempt to, like, approach that topic. And it's, like, already know what I want to say, yeah. And in my head, and it'd be like, now just go to afford some literature bag and his kids are 99% Sure the literacy is gonna say this. So let me just go and write it and then I'll reference it later. And then by the time we're finished writing and are looking for reference, like nine times out of 10 them right. Like and I'll be able to find a reference to back up whatever it was, I was trying to say, one time I tend to be like, no you actually wrong you're gonna get it where you write this there's no evidence to support this claim at all. Yeah, that stuff happens but I'm just picturing you know, it might take me you know, in noise moments, if I'm looking for one specific thing, one shred of evidence to back up this claim. Online, spend 2030 minutes reading a paper and walk away without what I need.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, I see you saying

Khamani Huerta: I have to go through it top to bottom, just looking for one line, just anything that I can use to say about this paper, say this. reference that whereas I'm just picturing that if I've got this tool if I can For a whole bunch of papers into it, go through it, pick out whatever section might sort of be relevant and then go to that section in the paper. I'll be able to find stuff to back up what I'm trying to say that much quicker. Again, that's not really the academic way of writing. It's kind of a shortcut way of writing, but it's incredibly useful. So

Jack Bowen: yeah, that's, that's okay, interesting. Did you try to like our, our question answering feature? Sorry, were you on the pro version or the other basic?

Khamani Huerta: I think I went for the pro version might still be on track, I got a new account with the, with my student account. I'm gonna have to sign for sign up for it and pay for it and everything. Oh,

Jack Bowen: there's just wondering if you'd use the other features to be honest in the in the pro version, search and stuff.

Khamani Huerta: Okay, let me check what I've got. So I've opened it up now. Account account status, subscription. Genius, pro academic discount, 14 day free trial. Okay. So what? Let me just find the paper and just chuck it in there.

Jack Bowen: Do you want to share your screen as well? I can kind of walk you through that? Yeah, sure. Cool,

Khamani Huerta: she's gonna wanna just grab a few ideas anyway Can I upload multiple documents at once? So

Jack Bowen: yeah, just go to you go to click Create resource areas. And then it will just drag you in there.

Khamani Huerta: Perfect. Still.

Jack Bowen: Oh, this is wonderful guys.

Khamani Huerta: I see you met, highlight and take notes as well as,

Jack Bowen: yeah, you can do that too, actually. So if you if you try like selecting some text, you can actually just increase the sort of reference links okay. If he Yeah. This one on the far left. Okay. Yeah, and then you can and then you can open

Khamani Huerta: those links this stuff in any way impact the summary that gets created?

Jack Bowen: No, not at all. In fact, if you pop up in the summary as well, for that document and then just put that if you just drag the tab onto the right, the one Yeah. And you go down to the summary. And open one of the sections. I didn't know which bit you would be coding show. And then do you see on the when you mouse over there's that button on the left there? Yeah, so you can actually just add those as well. Yeah, so you just whip through it and just add stuff in if it's interesting. That's great. Yeah.

Khamani Huerta: So I don't even have to fully read this I can just make a noise list and then just go back and skim over

Jack Bowen: pretty much

Khamani Huerta: okay, cool. Awesome. Can you change the order there is room

Jack Bowen: Yeah, yeah, it's just tech free text, you can just cut and paste it do whatever you like. It's like a bit like notion. So if you ever use that you can like you can like you can make different text blocks too. So if you select some if you do like a forward slash

Khamani Huerta: Okay, all right. So I can draw attention to different nodes.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, if you do look forward slash as well in the notepad you can actually you can put in different

Khamani Huerta: so you can pretty much write the whole essay in this like,

Jack Bowen: yeah. You do images, role and checklist if you want to Make like it to do list inside your. So you can do like a really

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, I can I'll put links in here as well.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, yeah, you can put links in if you select some text. And then you just click the link at the end. Yeah, you can just put in a. Yeah. You can also make this similar links to the ones that you've you've made a bit to the documents too. So you can if you do that add to notes thing. Yeah.

Khamani Huerta: So I can link to other sections a document.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. So if you see where it says link above that survey, close square bracket. Yeah. So if you click on that, it'll like show you where it came from. And you can make you can make your own monsters. Yeah. Yeah.

Khamani Huerta: Close this thing.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, you can. So if you just go back to that, if you open that project again, if you just drag the edge of it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, awesome. Yeah. Well, you can press them there's a shortcut. CTRL backslash.

Khamani Huerta: That's great. Okay. So if I'm looking for something on a really specific topic in a whole bunch of papers, then I get in this will draw across across papers. Yeah, yeah, just

Jack Bowen: the text. So it won't actually search the headers and stuff, but it will it will search inside the text. You can also ask it questions too. So you can say like, I don't know, how was the data coded? Really? Yeah. And then you see that one down there the Find a passage answering the question?

Khamani Huerta: I didn't know those things, survey response rates.

Jack Bowen: Maybe you're typing like survey response rates or what effects survey response rates maybe and then you can write paragraph about that. I just above

Khamani Huerta: that circle and then I can just make a noise.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. And you get references to

Khamani Huerta: what happened there this is like totally Chiti is say for us responsibly promise Yeah. Now this is like Whack a Mole People don't know that this like this is great.

Jack Bowen: I think I think it's a discoverability Oh, like two years.

Khamani Huerta: Wow. Okay.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Has

Khamani Huerta: it been like a slow sort of growth trajectory? Or like it's, it's it's been hard to get on people's map. So I think

Jack Bowen: I think it's been kind of difficult. Like people expect AI tools to like work perfectly like other kinds of productivity software, whatever, but obviously, results like variable that you kind of see like, you know, anything you type in like other questions like it might not do such a good job of answering them. Or like, sometimes the summaries are a bit off and so I think it's like that It's like a difficulty. There's like a lot of edge cases, I guess you have to kind of be ready for. And then also, I don't know why we've just we've had difficulty, like helping people discover these, like search features like they're we, you know, they're like a big part of it too. But for some reason, like, everyone gets the summary straightaway, but then the search is like, it's like, maybe it's like hidden or something. But yeah, seems like a bit of a leap to.

Khamani Huerta: In fairness, I probably wouldn't have played around with it this much if I didn't get a walkthrough. Yeah. So. Yeah, I don't know how much insight I can give him to that.

Jack Bowen: No, I think Yeah. I mean, it's obviously something we've kind of like worked through. I think, I think more more information out there about it probably just help help or on the board, really, but yeah, it's interesting.

Khamani Huerta: I'm the type of person and start raving about this stuff that I use, it does not work. Like, soon as I plugged in this thing into the paper or worked up into me, I'm like, Hey, guys, I found this amazing tool, this tool that this does what they say and they're like, What is your plan?

Jack Bowen: Yeah, yeah, I see that question for you. Like, what do you? What do you like least about the product? Is there anything here that isn't nice? Or that kind of like, didn't really work or was like, annoying, whatever?

Khamani Huerta: Look, I mean, I haven't played around with it enough to sort of have anything stand out as as something I've done in life. Maybe demo variability in any fence model? Oh, yeah. I mean by that is is. I mean, it's customizable and stuff. That's, that's quite handy. But everything's come black and white.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, it's quite, it's quite homebrew.

Khamani Huerta: Let's say if, if this section was even a slightly different colour, like a really light grey or something like that, or even if this slight ball was slightly different colour much itself sort of differentiated from the rest. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that is probably the surface that's nitpicky stuff, man. That's not it's not really anything that you sort of have to go back and change. It's not it's not a deal breaker for anyone. How did you sort of help with the navigation I think? Yeah, tabs as well. Yeah, this is this is like nitpicky like stuff, really. But I mean, if you can now this stuff, it does make it a bit easier to start sort of playing around with features. Honestly, like the pop up tools, the sorry, the pop up tips. I'd love to have an option to skip that. Because it from sort of a from, from Kenya and Russian, I know exactly what I want to do. And it's the first thing and there's only one thing that I want to do with it. And the third one you want to have to go through the tape spa might want to do it later. So like if I just if I'd rather just play around with it first and then be like, Okay, now showing how to use it.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Oh, that makes sense.

Khamani Huerta: Maybe if there was some type of usually when that kind of stuff on like, by the time I'm actually ready to sit down and learn about it. Like I'm willing to sit through like a three to five minute video that sort of covers everything I need to know. If it goes beyond five minutes, I'm probably not gonna watch it. Yeah. That's kind of the limit of my attention when it comes to tutorials.

Jack Bowen: yeah, or you go to if you go to the home, you can just make a quick one if you just want to do that. So you go generate summary.

Khamani Huerta: I can then I can just type whatever I want in here. So what's the difference between arrays Lesson summary is the resource the more comprehensive sort of knights and everything.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, so basically, if you just want to, if you just want to read something quickly, like, you're not really you don't really want to shove it in a project yet, because you don't really know, like, whether you're going to need it or not, you can just make a, you can just make a summary instead. And then like, if you like, read it in here, you can like go through and, you know, like all the summary sections and everything and like, it'll, you know, you'll kind of get the full, you get the full thing. And then if you want to save it, you can just hit save to project up at the top. And then at that point, it will like go into a project. But if you don't want to do that, then if you, if you just go back to the like, that other tab that just opened the quick summary flow up in Chrome. Like, if you scroll down summary history, like anything you put in there, or just kind of it'll just keep like a bit less of them. And so like, it's sort of, it's sort of like if you someone like sends you something, you're like, oh, I don't really know if it's useful or not yet, or maybe I just want to read it once and then I'm not going to use it again. It's just a kind of quick way to just get a summary in and then use it but you'd have to clutter up a project like adding it somewhere.

Khamani Huerta: Okay, yeah, he's getting rid of stuff out of this easy. Oh, yeah. That's fine. We'll

Jack Bowen: be back again.

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, just don't feel like the photo. I mean, not how it's intuitive. That resource and anoint within the context of what you're doing or not. And try, like, entirely sure. What hours right off the bat. Yeah, resources quite sort of broad concept. Yeah. If you can find another word for that, and probably, like, just just be more intuitive to use around. Yeah. Is

Jack Bowen: I'm, like, well, one thing is interesting, has come up a lot, which is the part time thing. So I've spoken to about, maybe, like, 1212 13 people now and like, almost like half of them are like doing part time studying or like, they have some sort of external pressure on their time that that, like caused them to look for a tool. Because I think, I don't know, my sort of cursory analysis of that is like, I feel like, if you're like, just a pure student, like you're not doing anything else, like, you're sort of the only pressure on your time, like, you could probably get everything done, but then you just have, like, you're also there to like socialise, and, you know, do all the rest of it. And so like, if you want to get more work done, you cut back on that. That's like the sort of immediate solution. Whereas like, I feel like if you're working as well, like, either class people I spoke to, there's like, one guy, he's like a teacher, and then he's doing like a teaching course, as well as like a master's. So he's, like, full time teacher, and then also doing this course, the other lady was like, she was like a nurse. And then she was doing like a PhD as well in like neuroscience. And so like, had to, like catch up on all this like literature, but was also being like a full time nurse. And so like, it sort of, I don't know, it hits this, like, I guess it hits this resonance, where where people are like, under have that sort of, they need to they, they need to be like they just need to be kind of very, very efficient with their their studying, if that makes sense. They can't take the they can't it's not like a sort of, yeah, it's I mean, I feel like I'm probably speaking to someone that understands that better, maybe, I don't

Khamani Huerta: know, I mean, he hit the nail on the head really like yeah, and in one way that the people that are sort of the most inept, but particularly in Australia were like, like, like PhDs, Omron, you know, if I'm not doing a PhD, but I know how much people that have done PhD, they're not remunerated very well, so people have to work on top of doing a full time PhD. So they're the people that tend to be the most time poor and have to read the most shit. So yeah, that like really are the ones that would benefit most from these kind of things. So because the amount of work information about African strain is enormous. I'm just thinking, like, would like let's say if someone had had targeted a couple journals or a couple of sources of information that that they wanted to review regularly Would there possibly be an integration feature where you're any new content that gets generated on those platforms automatically gets uploaded, I can check in with this regularly. Summary is already there waiting for me. I see anything useful. I've been delving further.

Jack Bowen: I think that's really interesting. Yeah, no, something that we've, I know, they're like, they're definitely like journals that do like these sort of releases where they're like, oh, you know, we've based on what you've based on what you've looked at, like, here are some other papers that you might find interesting. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, exactly.

Khamani Huerta: I just want to know, hey, is the studies been done? Here's what I found. Oh, that's interesting. I'm gonna go back to a closer look, you know, right, exactly. Like if I had this as sort of my central source of news articles, and Bikaner this first, you know, I wouldn't be checking in with a whole bunch of other news sites first, you know?

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's really interesting. Where do you get most of your content from?

Khamani Huerta: Honestly, because I realised, I feel stupid saying this. But the is I realised how much trauma I was spending on Facebook. I'm like, you know, I'm just going to whatever, like news sources on going to that little Facebook button, I'm just going to sign up to their stuff. I'm just going to wait for them to publish content. So I'm not visiting a million web pages shows up in my feed. It's all in one place. Yeah. And I've curated the news sources that are like informed me and now. So I've built my own little bubble. Yeah. And it just, it just gives me what I want. That's pretty cool. I'd rather not do that. Rather than not bank on Facebook's algorithms. Yeah, to tell me what I want. I go out and sort of have that pre populated with the new sources that I want. But I'm gonna sit there spending, how long sort of gone over every year? So

Jack Bowen: you don't want it to feed you all these sort of extremist? Extremist?

Khamani Huerta: Extremist academic stuff? Like, I have no idea. What this

Jack Bowen: question, how did you, how did you describe it to your colleagues? When you mentioned it? Like what was the like? What was the like? Yeah, what was the like, one? Sorry.

Khamani Huerta: The elevator pitch.

Jack Bowen: Exactly. Your your your elevator pitch? Yeah.

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, I said, As a graduate, and it's amazing thing that's just saving me so much time. Like, it's just it's helping me really, really long stuff really quickly, basically. And then I plan to expand from there. But But to me, the main, the main selling point was this thing is going to save me time, I'm going to be able to do more reading that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to do yet. So like that being said, I mean, for stuff that I actually need to read in detail from when I use it, like, let's say, for buying a nonfiction book or something like, yeah, stuff like that, no, probably don't want to go over that and why I might check it in, you know, when I'm finished. If I need to sort of find something that's specific, or, you know, I want to revisit a section or something like that. Really journal articles, like no one, for some reason in detail. For the most part, people skip the methods and the results, they just read in the intro and the discussion. If there's something useful there, if they need to scrutinise it a little bit further, then they'll go back and check the method and results. Like that's pretty standard in the academic world. And then I think that like, say, if you're going over abstracts, abstracts a word limited by the journal articles, so you're never going to get as much detail as you actually need to add to it.

Jack Bowen: valid? Right, I mean, you're you're like, you starting with a prior and, you know, determining whether it's true. I mean, it's sort of, you know,

Khamani Huerta: well, yeah, I mean, it's it's kind of as science works anyway, it's like you start with a hypothesis and then try and back it up. But usually, the evidence is meant to inform the hypothesis, not the error. But if you've spent long enough sort of getting a feel for stuff, you intuitively know what you expect the evidence to tell you when you go back and read it.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. What did your colleagues like? How was there any question like, how does it save you time? Like, what was your like? Or what was the? Yeah, I mean, if this was like, my manager, pull me up before I get to go into that much detail do you want me to do, I can repeat back? Sorry, I can write another I get to write an email. So I can write another one. If you want me to, just to like confirm all of this. Like, I don't want to get you in trouble that

Khamani Huerta: for the moment, if I need anything else, I'll let you know. Okay. Yeah. Have you successfully closed that chapter? Okay. Got it. She She's confident based on what I explained to her based on what you told me. Yeah. This is not an issue doesn't matter of further investigation. I'm not going to ask any more questions about it to click the little No. Okay. So you've definitely got enough to work with. That's all good. All right. Well, I'm gonna get to this assignment. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Can I ask you? One more thing just for you? Sure. So, okay. I'm thinking about like, next steps next raishin. It's quite handy, actually, that you're studying like psychology, like as a social science? Like, do you? Do you do any, like narrative interviews?

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, well, not narratively, I'm gonna do all of Dogwatch. And then it isn't run focus groups that are wasn't on the subject. And he likes him the fact that stuff before as well. So yeah, I'm pretty well versed in this stuff, for the most part, like

Jack Bowen: how, um, how does that? How does that? Like, how does that work? On a sort of, like implementation level? Like, do you? Like how do you how do you analyse the? I mean, yeah, how do you conduct the interview? Do you like record them? How does the analysis work afterwards?

Khamani Huerta: Ah, okay. Yeah, with that stuff, usually. Look at the moment most like we get, like, in the past, I've had to, like transcribe land. And I guess usually, what, what the purest qualitative researchers will tell you is that you don't know your data and until you've transcribed it, yeah. So they're like, until you fully immerse yourself in the transcription process, then you probably don't fully know your data doesn't stop people from using transcription services and stuff like that. Usually, once you get appropriate transcript, and there's order transcript services on like Microsoft Teams and stuff as well. But these days, like there's, there's, I haven't, they use that in my work, I'm playing around with it just yet and waiting for you to licence for NVivo. In vivo is meant to be somewhat of a synthesis tool. For qualitative researchers. I've used dovetail before as well. Pretty handy. Just useful for like hiding themes and stuff and working with transcripts and highlighting stuff. So usually, I kind of prefer to do this stuff manually by hand.

Jack Bowen: Why is that?

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, because there's this honestly, there's, there's always stuff that gets missed, when, you know, when when it's like, especially when concepts are like really loosely related, when one quote might fit multiple themes, you know, and a wide sort of fitted thing in mind sort of touch on one thing with like, 90% accuracy, but it's loose, really loosely related to this other theme, and you want to try and find a way to sort of link the two together. Be like my preferred method and sort of pull that all the quotes that are relevant, or checking in an Excel sheet. And I'll start putting the things up the top for each quote, and I'll start sort of putting putting an X in whatever things are going to be relevant to that quote that I find by the end of it, okay, these things sort of popping up the mice they'll start to get a feel for you know, what's what's, you know, for me to go back and rework things and stuff like that. So yeah, that's that's kind of my way of doing it. But like in terms of them, why not sort of be a traditional way of doing it doesn't million ways to do qualitative research, really, but I would, I guess I would, if I was collecting data, could probably be Be a bit more apprehensive about using about using AI. And that's why it's my initial impression or is it's not well developed enough to capture the new words, I'd probably have a lot more trouble sort of trusting it to make sure that I didn't miss anything. Okay? Because because particularly in qualitative research, there's usually a high level of nuance to the conversation. And the way I'm trying to facilitate focus groups and stuff these days is, is with a lot more emphasis on getting people used to technology, for example. So I'll get up to use the chat box more often, or I'll get into user reactions, put the hand up in the meeting and that sort of thing. And, you know, find those moments in, in groups or workshops where you're, I'll ask a question. Everyone's mics muted. No one's using any reactions, but everyone's nodding. And it's like, you're not going to capture that. In any type of qualitative software, you know, like it from two from gauging reactions as we're going along. There's not really any way that you're going to capture that. And even if I tell them, I'll be like, Listen, guys, you didn't use any reactions? You didn't put anything in the chat box. You didn't say anything. All the software that I use to capture this stuff, he didn't pick up on what just happened. Yeah, so interesting. Stuff like that. But they'll still do that. Like, they'll still be like, it kind

Jack Bowen: of reminds me of those, like, I know if you ever watch these, like kind of police crime thrillers, and they're sort of like, you know, like, the suspect knowledge. Yeah, exactly. You know, that like said, yeah.

Khamani Huerta: Wow. Yeah. It's like he, unless you've got someone who's sensitive to that stuff. They're probably not going to notice its absence. Yeah. For me, I don't want to miss any of that stuff. Because all of its important, all of what dictates what I get out of it.

Jack Bowen: So are you doing? Are you doing UX research, like software tools?

Khamani Huerta: No, no, no, don't UX research. It was just a subject. I didn't hear any. We have UX research teams that the agency I'm working with, on working within the research and insights team. So a lot of what we do is about sort of designing surveys, running focus groups, running workshops, collecting insights, doing data analysis, piecing it all together, trying to influence policy, evaluate projects, that sort of thing. So

Jack Bowen: interesting. Let me I'll just show you quickly why I'm kind of curious about this. So I'm sure the

Khamani Huerta: great excuse to procrastinate, by the way,

Jack Bowen: sorry, I'll let you go into where I get to talk, someone needs something this feels like I've done like a few these sort of things before, like this one for a while ago. And like, what I've kind of taken to doing is like transcribing stuff from like, I'll meet someone in person or whatever. And then we'll do like sort of focus session. And then I'll like transcribe, you know, some of the text and then like, put this through G, and then just use those like links, and like highlights, like pull out themes. And so I was just kind of wondering, like, it's interesting, because there's like, like, the tool seems actually worked quite well for like social science based research anyway, like, I put this one through about single single parent fathers or whatever, and like, you know, like it. It's pretty good, like, at least, you know, like anecdotally to, like, I've noticed that, like, you know, these summaries are actually like, very useful. And I think that the text is not like super simple, heavy or anything. So it goes in pretty nicely. And so what I'm like curious about is like, whether, I don't know whether there's some sort of opportunity, like maybe we could kind of start like a capsule here, like, maybe processing audio and letting people like, you know, like, because what I tend to do is like, I'll listen to these at like, 2x speed, and then I'll just use this to highlight stuff. Yeah. And then just kind of, you know, and then and then kind of like, he's like comments and like, sort of, yeah, figure out what

Khamani Huerta: Sure, yeah. Yeah, look, I imagine I'm sort of still quiet. I guess I'm there unorthodox in that there's some stuff I'd rather do manual and some stuff I have absolutely no interest in though. Like I don't want to be, I don't want to be transcribing an old song. Like I'm not a purist on any level with that stuff. But in terms of like, the actual, like, analysis of the themes and stuff that come out of it. I mean, I'm happy to get ahead from from, from any technology, it's added that I'm still not going to have 100% Complete Instant sort of its results like I'll still be wanting to go over it with a fine tooth comb to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Jack Bowen: I find I have to replay replay stuff quite a lot. Like, I mean, this lady like she, she's like a friend. And she studies my brothers. I met her and like, I think it was like yeah, it was like, somewhere around here. Like, the camera, like the fee broke up a little bit. So she actually said like, something quite useful, and then only found that by listening to it again. And so like, it's like, they got like, split out of the transcripts and like,

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, so like, I mean, it probably serves a it could probably be like a useful part of like one process of it, let's say like, let's say if you finish an interview straightaway, and you want to sort of get a snapshot of what happened in before you go back over with a fine tooth comb, this might sort of help you figure out where you want to focus on where you want to go to first or, you know, where something was located, you know, continue to value on that level. But in terms of like, time saving, like, I'm still gonna need to go back and replay it, you know, so I'm not I'm not really sure how much time it's saving me. Unless there was something specific I was looking for in a really long interview, I

Jack Bowen: can do that as well. You can do like questions like,

Khamani Huerta: when did they say something?

Jack Bowen: You're reading a bunch of stupid documents. So actual thinking? Yeah.

Khamani Huerta: All right. Need to play around with it? And

Jack Bowen: I'd be a Yeah,

Khamani Huerta: it's kind of the only way to do it.

Jack Bowen: Interesting, your thoughts because I've my, I'm like, not really an expert. Like I just kind of I read a bunch of blogs about how to do user research. And that's kind of what it based off of, but it'd be really great to hear from like a, like a, someone who's like, really in the field, like whether this is like a process that would be useful and like whether coding and be

Khamani Huerta: given the security thing I went through, I'm not gonna be able to work stuff. And that's why I that I'm not, I'm not running over to like focus groups and interviews. But I'm sure I'll get a chance to use it at some stage sometimes to do projects. So I work in that sort of thing. So

Jack Bowen: do you know anyone do you know Do you know anything? Won't be interested to chat to

Khamani Huerta: you the guys I used to work for excellent. Yeah, they were management consultants. They do quite a few interviews and in the run quite a few workshops. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Now we're gonna touch with them on the details. Because these guys the the genuinely torn port as well, I've done management consulting, these guys are under the pump constantly. Yeah. And they want to be evidence based. And they're all from sort of like, like, you know, social science backgrounds and stuff. So now to do the research. They just don't have the time. So, yeah. So might be useful for them. No, no.

Jack Bowen: That would be fantastic. If you wanted to only if you were like comfortable interacting, like if they want to chat. I don't know, like, wasting his time because he really busy. But yeah, you know,

Khamani Huerta: they'll have time to chat. But these are the kind of guys where like, if something's useful, that's better, of course, the organisation. So like, if a totally useful though, adopter on less. Yeah. So they'll work like that. And, you know, they were able to integrate technology really quickly into their business practice when COVID Here, anyone I've seen so the open to technological solutions. They just have to see the value in it really isn't. It's not only how to sell them on the value of it. so

Jack Bowen: stunning. Brilliant. Yeah, I'd really appreciate that.

Khamani Huerta: Yeah, for sure. I'll throw it out there. And yeah, that's what comes in. In the meantime, if I get any other feedback or anything, definitely.

Jack Bowen: Alright. If there's any anything else else I can do for you as well. Just drop me a message and have yourself.

Khamani Huerta: Appreciate it. You just yeah, you pulled me out of this security issue. So awesome,

Jack Bowen: awesome. Thanks for your time cream. I really enjoyed chatting with you. This is quite fun. Actually. We should do
