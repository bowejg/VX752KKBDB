Hello?

0:01
Hi Richard, how you doing?

0:04
Good things.

0:05
Sorry about all the back and forth.

0:06
No worries, no worries.

0:09
Nice to meet you.

0:10
Hello.

0:12
Likewise, I'm Alex sent you an email earlier, Jack Jack Genie.

0:20
So yeah, basically working on the like product in customer research side of things, so users finding out what works, what doesn't and what we're going to build next.

0:31
Elena.

0:32
Cool.

0:34
so yeah, I guess as a bit of background to genius, what we're doing, I don't know how much Alex told you.

0:39
We are basically a startup in the kind of research text space.

0:46
We our first product was a tool for students and academics to summarize background background reading for literature review.

0:56
We released that in like january 2020 scale that up to a few few 1000 paying users and then kind of that's been kind of running the background and in the meantime we've sort of been looking at some other kind of product areas otherwise where we can kind of add value in the in the research base, we got quite interested in in quo off the back of doing a lot of like product research for that, that first, that first thing you know, we found that speaking to users and doing that sort of primary research and serving was enormously powerful for shaping our product direction.

1:30
I think we just got really, really interested in it as a space after we kind of saw like how far I guess it can take you as a, you know, as a company if you're solving a problem or whatever.

1:42
And so we kind of look at some of the existing solutions that were out there, we've we've tried out various other tools for doing our own research.

1:50
And I felt like there might be a bit of an opportunity there, especially with performance of of new Ai models and and like capabilities of the technology.

2:01
And so since then I've been speaking to a number of different sort of qualitative research is to kind of understand the problems based a bit more and understand people's processes.

2:12
And and kind of see where you know, whether there's an opportunity for us to develop something and how we might be able to help with that process.

2:21
Oh and so we're getting into the whole round of chat GPT here.

2:29
Yeah, so we do use big transformer models.

2:32
I think our viewpoint though is that if you if you can look at the space for like cool research tools that there are some there was some kind of existing ones that are they're they're they're kind of improvements over I suppose using tooling that was never really designed called research in mind, but they're quite manual.

2:54
So I'm thinking things like dovetail or in vivo where it's a lot of like manual tagging.

2:59
And then there's this kind of new newfangled range of tools like thematic and viable which are trying to use ai as a sort of black box to like spew out the answer for you.

3:11
And I think what we didn't really like about those is the fact that they really detract from the like, human element.

3:18
They're not really a copilot fuel research, they're just sort of trying to like badly replace the what we kind of saw like the important part of doing this and so our like thesis and like remit in which within which we want to design is something to kind of help people actually work faster in in the way that they want to work and in the way that kind of keeps humans doing a bit that's that's valuable for them and helps machines kind of automate some of the more tedious parts whilst leaving them in control of the process.

3:46
And the main owner of it.

3:49
Yeah.

3:49
Which I think is a very eloquent eloquent summary of like I know where myself and lots of us are at.

3:57
So I mean just by way of sort of background and intro to where I'm at, it's been in the research base for Dawn bookies years.

4:08
I've built and sold my own software as well in the mobile space.

4:14
Now I've been consulting in research tech generator agencies about to actually from the first time jumping into a full time role on the board of a small agency called fire fish to drive their whole innovation and tech tech enabled growth.

4:32
this whole area is really is quite interesting.

4:35
So you're right in the crawlspace?

4:39
The great thing about what tech has done for kuo is been able to like produce tons and tons of new stuff, video, audio transcriptions, etcetera.

4:50
The bad news is that's like how do you get your head around all of that and find the insight?

4:55
So yes, so things have been moving and I think, I think, I mean dovetail is an interesting one because I've been looking at that for how do we transcribe and store and mine insight out of the video that gets captured.

5:13
But then obviously we've now been talking like literally for the last three weeks about chat gpt which has just exploded in this space.

5:23
But what you just said, Jack was quite interesting because everyone's like freaking out that they're all not gonna be out of a job.

5:31
But actually I think this intersection of using this stuff to cut out all the stuff in the process you have to do like this really boring to leave you time to do the good stuff.

5:43
So I think that feels like where you're at philosophically is aligned.

5:49
So I think we're a lot of a lot of quality qualitative researchers especially will be feeling right now, please don't replace us with robots but help us.

6:01
Yeah, I think the whole because the whole, this is all about insight into humans, isn't it?

6:10
And nothing even there's a lot of traction this evening quant spaces with big data is like remembering that behind big data is real people and real lives and how do you how do you keep that human?

6:20
So yeah I think all these tools to help people great but we were talking the other day about chat G.

6:28
T.

6:29
And going well If it can help write as a qualitative discussion guide that's 80% good enough to go to a client in like 30 seconds then we can step in as humans and make it 100% good enough to go to clients.

6:43
But that process might take us a day normally and now we can do it in like half an hour.

6:48
And then you've got you got creative proposal discussion guides and then you've got the analysis of the content on the back.

6:56
So yeah that that's definitely the space that is is a hot space right now.

7:01
So so what do you what do you specifically how how did how did Jeannie work?

7:07
So in terms of our our efforts and like producing something for the call space we built a small prototype which we've tested out which were still very much like exploring and iterating.

7:19
this was very much just like you know we we built it as quickly as possible.

7:23
Just kind of see it would be helpful and the concept was something along the lines of sort of similar to chat GPT but more like referenced and based on your own content.

7:35
So the idea would be that you upload all of your transcripts or documents or evidence to it and then you can ask it questions about that evidence and it can essentially give you you know some sort of thematic analysis, extraction quotes for you but crucially everything that any statements that makes a reference and take you back to like a key point within a document or transcript that you've uploaded.

8:05
And so I think as I say like we're trying to kind of develop the concept that we built a prototype of this and we've tested it out on some of our own feedback data and I think results are probably a little mixed.

8:21
and I think what we're kind of curious about is like really just trying to like dig in deeper and understand whether this is actually the best solution.

8:29
Whether this type of interfaces that kind of is actually the best way to like let people kind of explore their own data and think about it where there was a sort of competitive product two hours in the academic space called elicit who produced this sort of interface for research papers where effectively you're able to like you know if you're familiar with this but essentially it would allow you to take a research paper and then run like a query or take a set of research papers and run like a query over each one.

9:00
So it kind of extract like the key points So for instance these are all medical research papers and here it's you know, it's it's extracting outcomes measured from each one of these, so you can kind of compare across all the papers.

9:13
And so we were kind of you know, wondering, you know, there's a trying to say like I think we're developing an understanding of the problem, we're trying out some solutions really.

9:24
This was like another approach we thought that might be interesting for people as well.

9:28
That leaves them still a bit in a bit more control of like what's going on, I'm able to see the results, I can kind of imagine this working in a way whereby you could have each of your interviews and you can kind of ask it like thematic questions or maybe ask it to find a similar quote across a range of interviews, something like that.

9:46
That's so that's kind of the kind of stage right sort of exploring the problem, developing a bit of an understanding.

9:52
Starting to push out some EVP, starting to test them.

9:55
Yeah, no I mean there's I suppose a bit I don't know the answer to at the moment, I've got no actually got a session on on this in the business tomorrow morning.

10:08
you can kind of see where that conversation goes and that might be a way of introducing you guys as a partner with the bit that's still not clear for me with the whole chat GPT stuff is is a bit you just said about how do I use I know how do I use the and the tech on the stuff that I've done in research.

10:32
So I can totally see how you can go.

10:35
I don't know design me a research project to understand the growth of Tequila in the U.

10:41
K.

10:42
And it can go out and come back and tell me you're the different because it's been trained on those databases but you wouldn't want to just it's not going to know what you've done in your research project in that opening sort of platform.

10:55
And it's not and it's not any so open you wouldn't want to put your confidence to research.

11:00
So there's a bit that I don't know it's almost like there needs to be like a layer that goes over that technology but it's kind of I guess private and personal and understands what I'm trying to do as a qualitative business.

11:15
Right?

11:17
And then that's where you come in that yeah I can I mean I can just kind of show you the thing live to be honest on some of our data.

11:25
I can see that.

11:29
So like these are these are a bunch of user interviews we did we've stopped all the names around.

11:35
And this is kind of some feedback from like a year ago and our original product, so you can kind of ask it start like a new chat, you can ask it questions like first thought like what are the main the problem, jesus?

11:55
Mhm.

12:03
and so you can see it's kind of pulled out some sort of thematic analysis, so like a steep learning curve summarization wasn't always accurate, protein save summaries, not as powerful as other summarization tools.

12:16
And then you can click through these references and kind of see like where it's where it's sourcing this information from would be right in thinking if let's say if we if we gave you, I don't know, a ton of past research, you know, transcripts, debriefs etcetera, that would help train up and build up the library references.

12:49
Yeah, so you can upload, you can upload more stuff to it, more interviews, you know, you can also put in your own notes, various other things like that, and it will kind of use those to supply its answer.

13:03
I would say that what what I would say we're looking for at the moment in our sort of product journey is a couple more really solid interviews with users, I think where we we share this this sort of concept and like kind of chat some a bit more, I think it has a really big like kind of cool factor and it's definitely like in vogue right now, the whole sort of chat about approach.

13:26
but I think I want to be sort of really really rigorous about like whether it's actually the fastest way to kind of whether it's actually the most appropriate way to kind of tackle the issue that people experience Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean certainly we've got access to yeah, to a whole bunch of qualities who are doing these projects and wrestling with this and I know dan who heads up the team would be quite interested because they, you know, as I say, they still wrestle with most qualities do of all this content that from my project.

14:12
Yeah, I got how do I jump start into my analysis by wrapping my arms around all this stuff really quickly.

14:22
A lot of what is done at the moment is straightforward, kind of use of machines to effectively come back with, Well, here is the most popular keywords, so most people in this project said most people these projects and innovation or whatever, which is handy because that points you to where the common conversations are happening, although just because people send them a lot doesn't mean it's kind of important and like some of the most important stuff might be less frequent.

14:54
So most of the most of the output is based on just frequency of mentions, whereas obviously something like this is where you can continually question it and nudging and kind of get to the point you're really trying to get to or map it more closely to your specific project objectives.

15:11
So I think definitely we're getting into this sort of this next generation of all this stuff which this is at the heart of it.

15:21
So let me, yeah, as I said, I've got this session on this tomorrow.

15:28
Let me have a think.

15:29
And let's talk about it and and see if there's see there's an appetite of dan's team to yeah to talk to you and have a look at this and give you some feedback because it would be really interesting to, yeah.

15:47
I mean I'm only hesitating because of like I don't think that the team have only literally just even heard of Jack chat Gpt.

15:56
So the whole the whole topic is brand new but but certainly I think it's that's what we're all talking about.

16:04
Like I mean right now for instance like you know, we've had calls to follow up tomorrow with some of the I.

16:11
C.

16:11
G.

16:11
Members, like if you're familiar with them like Kath and that from the Yeah.

16:16
Yeah.

16:16
Yeah.

16:17
Yeah.

16:18
Who you know, we've been chatting to, you've been super helpful providing us with feedback and I think will be will be really ideal for us would be just some sort of like design partnership or just a just a group of interesting people, we can kind of, you know, roll out roll out some of these prototypes over a few weeks and just get some feedback and see if they're actually useful and for the stage where, you know, like when, you know, when, when we're not, we're not interested trying to rack up sales or revenue or anything.

16:46
We just want to kind of figure out whether we can make a difference and yeah, Yeah, I think I just think, yeah, I'm just, it might be, it might be quite a timely conversation because I think where I'm working now is going to be okay.

17:06
We all know, basically understand the concept of what this stuff can do, but how do we take this?

17:12
Just broad, I guess, Launchpad around chat GTP into something that's quite, really actively helps us and can be done in a way that's kind of quite unique to our business.

17:25
And so I don't think we know the answer to that, but it might just be that we go on a journey together to figure that out.

17:33
Yeah, I think, I think that's, that's the kind of thing.

17:35
I think we'd be looking for really like, yeah, just deep, deep inside understanding of how we can, you know, how we can kind of help out in this sort of area.

17:45
I think, as I say, like, we got got interested because I think it was like a problem.

17:50
We experienced ourselves our own with our own product feedback, but we don't have anywhere near the amount of like experience or like, like training as a lot of, a lot of you guys, you know, in the industry from YC.

17:59
G.

18:00
So I think it's good to kind of understand like what what if our assumptions are like right or wrong and what what, you know, what are the ways that like the sort of real professionals do this and like how how we can really speed that up?

18:12
Yeah, no, be happy, be happy to help.

18:15
It could be something quite quite timely in it.

18:19
I mean from your point of view, and again, I'm still trying to fill in my own blanks in this.

18:24
So you've seen all the open ai stuff that's kind of so so that that sort of database of what they've trained, the ai on, it's just sort of, I don't know, like 10 years of the internet, right?

18:40
And just throw everything in it.

18:43
So that's a massive thing.

18:45
So in terms of getting something kind of stylized within a very specific piece of it, like qualitative research projects, would you have two equally, You know, throw tons and tons of like past projects into it so it can learn what matters what doesn't matter etcetera.

19:05
You can you can you can fine tune them on like small numbers of examples, I think, you know, we've we've sort of found that like you can you can kind of set them up in a sort of few short way where you can give it you know, a small number of examples within like a prompt that's kind of dynamic and it can actually be fairly flexible within those constraints.

19:28
I think I think the capability is there, I think I think the real sort of the real thing that's missing really is just that like, understanding of like how to deploy it.

19:39
Well is it a chat, but is it is it a is it more of like a search engine?

19:44
Is it something a bit more like this sort of illicit tool where you can kind of the same query over lots of bits of evidence and kind of see where the patterns are that way or you know, what's the sort of right way to deploy it I guess in a similar in a similar vein to the things you're thinking about, we're trying to ascertain is a chat GPT style interface, something that is actually valuable inquire research at the moment or is the solution something else?

20:09
and that's kind of the hypothesis we wanna test really.

20:12
Yeah, so yeah, some of the, I guess the the interface and the way you interrogating the way it gets presented back is what you really.

20:25
Yeah, yeah, no, that makes total sense.

20:32
Okay, well look, leave it with me as I say, I'll do this session tomorrow, talk to dan see see what comes of it, but I think yeah, it feels like we ought to kind of put you put you guys into the mix to, to potentially have some chats about ways in which, you know, the team would find it, you would find that most useful.

20:58
So as I say, we're starting at this very stark, throw some questions into the chat gpt thing and iterate on that.

21:06
But like you say, organizing that within a totally works fine for generating proposals, discussion, organizing data.

21:19
It doesn't feel like that would work very well.

21:21
So how qualitative people also like generally quite quite visual people.

21:28
So that sort of output is often and they're dealing a lot with video and imagery as well as just text as well.

21:36
So how, how these things can help analyze that stuff is also an interesting question on the subject.

21:46
Sorry, just sparked my interest in something that we've kind of been discussing as well regarding like visualizations of information.

21:53
Is that something that tends to go into like a finished report?

21:58
Like I know in quant there's a lot of graphs and, and like visualizations and is that the same, is that the same in quote or is that more just for understanding or do those visualizations go into like a finished report on deck?

22:11
yeah, so it's, they will, it's obviously a very different from kind of Kant Bar charts and one of the most useful things is if I've taken, I've taken hours of video footage or people have uploaded things from their phones.

22:31
I've got, let's say 20 hours of video I will at the end in my debrief to my client.

22:38
Want to have like three minutes of killer quotes of people talk.

22:42
How do I get all those hours to those?

22:45
So I upload to the platform.

22:48
I auto transcribe.

22:49
I search and I stitched together little clips that's a bit of tape and the thing comes in so that kind of output being then dropped straight into a PowerPoint deck onto the client definitely.

23:04
And I think as well collages of images too.

23:10
But you know a lot of coal debriefs still quite text heavy.

23:15
I mean visualizations are not nice little infographic e type of things but probably still less outside of the video and image.

23:25
I guess evidence from respondents of these things is probably not as rich as say quant data visualization.

23:35
But I think there's anything, anything that much of research from A to Z is still quite a lot of manual labor involved in lots of it.

23:47
Right.

23:49
And and so the more the more the industry has been going towards automating the bits of it, it can people are spending their time on projects doing that manual stuff the better I think it's probably got a little bit, it's done much better in that in quant that automation because quant is generally you know, a little bit more repeatable and a bit more static.

24:15
You know I asked the same questions, I get the same kind of data back, there's always displayed in the bar chart.

24:21
Quality is much much more open.

24:23
So every project is different.

24:26
Every set of evidence you get back is different.

24:29
So all raising lots of that is quite tricky but as I said, to get there through through transcription and and so on and what you've got here and and the chat GPS tape will take us further I think has a lot of power in being able to interrogate it just then.

24:49
Yeah.

24:49
How best to do it?

24:51
How do you train and what's the best interface?

24:55
How do you deploy it with these interfaces?

24:57
Actually, one thing that I'm curious as well that we've been kind of trying to figure out.

25:03
We were so we were kind of looking through our notes from about 55 conversations we had and it's super common for people to use Excel for thematic analysis, but everyone kind of hates it as well.

25:19
And I'm I'm we were just kind of, you know, we're trying to understand why why why do people, why do people resort to it if it's a I don't know, it's a very like it seems like a very unequal like tool to use for, you know, like it's totally yeah, it's telling, it's a good question, I think because I mean one of the big, you know, I mean people have got into doing it because it has typically been a lot of the platforms where you're collating or collecting all of this have only ever really been able to spit it out in kind of C.

25:58
S.

25:58
V.

25:58
File SB Ss or whatever.

26:00
So even if it's more open ended unstructured text that's forced it into Excel now, you're right qualitative research, especially like I don't want to get into excel, but at the time it's the only thing they could do.

26:14
And then the other big driver in in the research industry, quite frankly is inertia and laziness.

26:19
So the amount of times you see a better platform, people always say, oh I know that that's better.

26:27
Could save me loads of time, but there's something else I have to learn and this might not be particular efficient but I know how it works.

26:35
You have this all the time.

26:36
You see new platforms all the time coming in going yeah it looks brilliant but I just don't have time to learn a new platform.

26:42
So that's what I think white people got stuck and going, exhale is awful.

26:46
I hate it.

26:47
But at least I have learned.

26:54
But again, I think if you can, you know, if you can present present people with these interfaces that are just simple, intuitive and again, like a lot of what I think it's been really interesting if there's more of this stuff comes from outside the market research industry, the more it's actually I think proving to be slightly easier and more intuitive to use because lots of times things that get built up from within the industry almost so trapped in knowing all the nuances and nitty gritty that they get stuck in the nitty gritty and don't always produce something really super intuitive, whereas, again, looking at what you just did there, like the chat Gpt stuff, like it's so great, you can just crack on and start doing it and therefore there is no, there is no barrier, there's no one boarding was getting I was getting nervous when, you know, in demos and things, you know, the platform talks about their great support service and huge onboarding program and you're going to go, well, if you need that much support onboarding, this sounds like it could be quite hard to use.

28:05
Yeah, I thought of in vivo, when you, you kind of mentioned the nitty gritty of things that that one, I was kind of looking into it and it seemed like, I don't know, I think I saw a screenshot of the en vivo, it's like it was, yeah, this whole thing and I was like, yeah, I don't know, I kind of see it exactly.

28:41
People don't have time for that, you'd rather be getting that output quickly and having a conversation about like, where did this come from out of the algorithm work or whatever.

28:51
How do I even get that?

28:55
We've got many things to get it, I'm not going to do it okay interesting and like what's okay, so it's it's, it kind of sounds like that.

29:09
It's it's basically a case of like almost like habit changing of a habit, right?

29:16
Like you kind of need that motivation, ability and trigger for someone to like wanna swap.

29:25
Yeah, I mean it's it's like it's all those, there is a books about how we make decisions, how our brains work, behavior economics theory, isn't it?

29:34
Number one, it's like, you know, cognitive load, I just don't make it as soon as you make it slightly tricky.

29:41
I'm just going to move onto the next thing.

29:44
I think it's judging, judging what too tricky is, but certainly, you know, like I say from some chat deep dive in and go playing with it to something that looks like I'm going to need 14 hours on a webinar to understand that, you know, that's a huge one.

30:06
So yes, my current practices are not great.

30:09
I know they're not great.

30:10
I know they're a bit antiquated, but until you show me something that is clearly better, but also clearly easy, I'm gonna have some resistance to it interesting and I think also like positioning wise of how this stuff genuinely support you in your analysis rather than trying to replace you in analysis is quite key as well.

30:39
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

30:42
Okay, the other thing is what I was wondering if you could like kind of clean this off a bit for us to like, we were like also just going through the exercise of like trying to understand what all the possible angles worth for coal research because I think obviously like we saw it, see it in our own, our own, you know, in our own case and also, I guess like widely in the sort of tech industry, like a lot of product teams are doing something akin to, to call research and then, you know, I guess there were like other areas that, you know, that I guess kind of surprised me that I suppose we're sort of obvious when you think about it, but things like you know, I didn't realize the NHS as a whole patient experience team whose job it is to kind of basically conduct studies on, on like patient welfare and understand how the services can improve.

31:32
you know, we came across like action groups, like citizens advice charities, you know, policy research, like, do you have a good kind of breakdown of like what the kind of big areas are in, which you know, in which like, I suppose like, which would fall into like coal research, like what types of individuals, I guess, you know, a sort of a good assimilation for that space?

32:00
Well, I mean, yeah, it runs across, runs across everything that the brands and organizations are doing and you know, you've got, you've got kind of, you know, classic I guess classic quo which is deployed by everyone.

32:21
When I say like the N.

32:22
H.

32:22
S.

32:23
Tfl to coke to Unilever which is you know, understanding to understand consumer behavior, consumer motivations you know buying, traveling, making decisions and that's what you'll do classically, you know ethnography, focus groups if you get into the world like creative development and and looking at how people react to marketing stimulus and stuff.

32:51
So it is everywhere.

32:54
you know every kind of vertical every industry.

33:01
I think in recent years tech has opened up this whole kind of idea about call it scale.

33:11
So that's where you know, Doing focus groups of 8-10 people versus say, you know getting you know, sort of like like NHS or like any kind of organization like deliveroo or whatever.

33:27
Getting constant customer experience feedback all the time, huge data sets of like thousands upon thousands of open and stuff.

33:35
And there's a big debate about whether that's still quality scale or is that moved into quant Especially now you can codify that really really quite quickly.

33:45
So I don't think there's any any sort of limits to where where has a role to play.

33:54
I mean I've always thought that actually quo more than quant should be thriving in the world.

34:00
We're living with big data because a lot of a lot of data that's now gathering.

34:05
I think it means you don't need to go out and do lots of surveys of people because you've got the data but you still need to do the qualitative understanding of why that's all happening and what's motivating people to behave like that.

34:17
So so I think you could kind of look everywhere.

34:21
I mean research agencies are obviously great places but a lot of creative agencies and have like planners and they do lots of like insight and trying to understand strategy based in real kind of human understanding and behavior so and no limits.

34:41
And on that note I think you're a great person to ask because obviously your work you have experience working in tech and now you're looking at kind of innovation and implementation of new solutions.

34:52
Is there anyone that you anyone or any type of person that you think would be useful for us to reach out to and speak to about this sort of thing?

35:03
Yeah I'm sorry I'm just gonna move quickly.

35:09
My wife and I share an office and she's actually called research.

35:15
That's right.

35:21
Yeah I mean that yeah I'm just trying to think, I mean there's loads of people I could intro you to where's the best place to go?

35:35
When you talk to people at the I.

35:36
C.

35:36
G.

35:41
Yeah you want to talk to people more about, is this more for like kind of feedback from other qualities or is this more like research tech kind of people I think I think like we said earlier, I think we've I think we've kind of identified a problem in in the in the synthesis in the synthesis and analysis of qualitative research.

36:04
It's more about how we implement a solution in in the most useful way possible.

36:09
So I think that's a mixture of feedback potentially like a design partnership speaking 21 who has relevant experience in the in the space with research tech, who you might, you know, we might be able to clean insight for more.

36:22
Why don't we?

36:23
I think Richard, I think you mentioned team earlier.

36:25
Why don't we?

36:26
we can put together like a one page or like just a little like blurb about what we're doing and then I can kind of follow that up after this.

36:32
Cool.

36:32
If that would be helpful and then if you want to bring it to them and if anyone wanted to have a chat then that's probably easiest way to kind of move forward I guess.

36:38
Yeah, yeah, do do that.

36:40
So I'm just thinking there are there are a couple of interesting people who kind of I think are at the center of brokering lots of conversations around research tech and there's a guy and there's a guy called Mike stevens who runs a website called insight platforms.

37:02
We came across that.

37:04
Yeah, so I know mike really well but he's yeah, he's great at knowing like where your place in the world might be and and offering thoughts on that.

37:18
And he's just been launched.

37:20
We just launched.

37:20
He just did a GPT webinar last week.

37:23
So he's definitely someone I can connect you to because he's always resident in latest stuff.

37:31
And then there's probably, yeah, there's probably a few other people that I'm just thinking about, some different platform companies I know who would be interested in this space, but if you send me send me one page and let me let me do my own digging within what I'm up to, and then a few people be worth connecting you within the space.

37:57
Okay, let's do that.

37:58
Then we'll follow up and you'll be great, great to kind of keep the conversation going.

38:02
And definitely, definitely it's good because it's like, it feels it feels, yeah, you're you're in the right, I say you're in the right space, it's still quite ill defined, which is good.

38:15
It's not quite like, again, it's it's kind of quite this needing to synthesize lots of call data is not particularly new and I know lots about that, but this particular way of doing it is still, we're all trying to go actually where it's not like, oh excellent, you fit right here.

38:33
It's still pretty early days, which is which is exciting.

38:36
And I think good for way you seem to be right now, yes, send that over and let's keep talking and I'll think of some people to connect to brilliant.

38:47
Yeah, I think, I don't know, I must say as well like I think it's it's very like, I don't know, it's it's I think it's, it's one I think we found quite easy and excited about two and that like I think as I mentioned it just kind of seeing the impact that it had on like our our product development and and kind of hearing about other projects people have worked on and like, you know how it can kind of improve things or change policies or whatever.

39:12
It's just quite, it's quite sort of inspiring so yeah, it's a great, great areas being for sure.

39:20
Cool, Alright, yes, page, I'll make some connections and I'll think about you in light of what I'm about to do next as well.

39:30
Thank you so much.

39:33
Good luck.

39:34
Thanks the chat bro.
