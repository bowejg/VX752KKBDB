Some of the challenges faced within that from memory. I think we talked about like Xbox calls background reading that kind of thing the example we talked about from memory. I believe was like a due diligence we talked about you divisions because they're the most routine and time pressure project. And yeah, so we've put together an MVP of a product and we've got a landing page and

what I'm trying to do the strategy basically that we're pursuing is like

We want to iterate the product get feedback from people and then also.

we want to

Build up like a waiting list of people who might be interested in using it and to do that. We kind of need to make sure that like the messaging on the website is like is like attractive and like makes sense to people so to two things. Oh, I'd be interested. You're kind of help with like first see like

I'd like to like kind of show you this webpage. And if you want to just like scroll through it, maybe like share your screen just kind of like tell me what you're thinking and then kind of show you the product and sort of and you'll probably get a sense of it from the website and

And then kind of give me your like initial reactions to that as well. I'll be really helpful.

Sounds great. So I share my screen and you can walk me through I'm going oh, yeah sure here. Let me just send you the link to it.

you

wait, right?

Yeah, so crucially like

what we're trying to

we're trying to ascertain from this really is like do people understand.

It's like two things so.

Let me get my list. It was basically do you understand what the product is? And do you understand what problem it solves and you understand like why you would be compelled to use it as kind of the questions. I'm trying to answer so like yeah, I guess as you scroll through this, let me just kind of give you give me your initial thoughts and reaction.

Yeah, this is good.

I like these nice.

Let's Clint doesn't says these are the types of documents that I'll listen to and it allows you to.

You know, basically our data.

I'm asking questions.

Okay, so those links aren't real. No, okay.

Can you can you put multiple?

I didn't realize most AIS could do this. I thought they were quite bad.

I've lost you.

Hello.

Hello. Hey, sorry you cut out there for a second. Oh, well, I can't hear you. I'm yeah, I'm surprised at let me let me

I'm surprised that the AI is able to do this because I didn't know that you get one giving that sources. That's really cool.

Do you?

Does that make you if I'm reading into that you ever sense of skepticism about that? Well, like what's the internal concern? Like that's I guess it's not skepticism as much as like if you can do it. That's really great. Okay. And is that specifically the referencing or yes, okay.

Know I know the AI like it's not huge.

From what percentage EBT so they're getting to this but like actually saying here's where we get from like, you know, I mean, that's very impressive.

and

the other the other thing that I think

looking at this having used chat GPT.

the big

the big thing the sort of

I'd like serious differentiation.

It's not the explore sign.

Maybe a little bit the synthesized if it's like tailored to Consulting.

But it's actually upload. Okay the fact that you can like.

Upload your own set of reference materials.

right

You know what? I mean? That's like

like because kids going on on charge EBT you can like ask it, you know a question of like yeah 100 Words and you say synthesize this or whatever. Yeah, or is this you can be like

fucking banging 30 articles

Hopefully get something useful out. Yeah, okay.

so

I just saw my instant reaction save time every project.

this

build a mental model. I don't like the language.

Okay, I don't know what that means.

Let me try and explain and then maybe see if you can kind of help me kind of convert better. Like one of the things we heard from a few people is basically like with these due diligent style things like your encountering like an industry often that you've like

not really dealt with before is understood. So like one guy spoke to was like he did it you did it to repeat company that we're trying to buy a company that makes bathrooms for trains. So so they they're like Waste Disposal Systems for the mobility industry or something and he obviously knows, you know, absolutely nothing about about that. And so like, you know, one thing he said was that like with a lot of these things so it's hitting this like reset but every time and you have to like find it new industry and then like

to understand it in his words like build a mental model of like what that market looks like who the players are that kind of thing. I don't know if what's a better way maybe of like expressing that perhaps um,

Do you is that is that is that something it's I mean for his first question. Is that something that you resonate with or yes? Yes. It is. Absolutely is.

It's absolutely something I resonate with.

helps you

because uncovered Keys insights instantly is like yeah.

Baby, that's money. You know what I mean?

but

I'm just thinking about linguistically what's a better way of

build a mental model that helps you become an expert in no time. I don't know the common expert. Yeah, how do you rapidly they're coming expert and uncover this key inside like it. I don't want to over engineer. It's just build a mental model is quite yeah. That was specific language, okay.

Great. Let's crack on I'm

and I just

yeah, I love this.

yeah, this is actually like a serious differentiation point

this is the sort of thing. That sounds like it's a it would be really important, but won't be

right

and to me

because it's going to be incredibly hard to get the AI to like produce actually truly what slides?

yes you

especially because everyone has different style and so

the best you're gonna do is basically just like no bulleted notes that have been hasted in Powerpoint.

Which are significant minority of slides that you'd want to have looking like that. Yeah. I have noticed that.

Okay. Yeah, because I think

Well, I kind of saw I looked through some examples like a lot of the slides were.

infographics rather than

rather than like chunks of text very few slides in a Consulting DD will be just a chunk of text. Okay.

Whereas the finance guys they do that.

Okay, that makes sense. I think we probably.

Need to rethink. Oh damn, I didn't realize the Emojis look different on everyone's computer. That's like mildly racist.

I get a picture of like a genie with like a lamp or something.

interesting

and then I would change the email.

Okay to something like what like sales or support or info sales hell if it's sales at genie.io, which is just another links to me.

It doesn't like a boarding address to Jack if you need to I oh you're not I mean, yeah is is that a is that is that a kind of sort of expected professional?

Thing or only the only reason I do it. Yeah.

To me, it feels like a small hygiene Point. That's not good for you. Don't worry about it. No. No, I think I think it's valid. Oh, it just it just makes you feel more professional. Yeah.

For it to be like, oh, no, we could be a huge company. Yeah, whereas if it's like

look at all really great.

You know.

Whatever breaking AI stuff then it's email me Jack. It feels a bit like a cottage industry. Right like it's an industry. Yeah you so you sort of paste the mysterious bail of the Court. Yeah.

that's I like that the mysterious veil of the corporate and then of course if you know the point which they've reached out to sales at

Genie did actually

yeah, yeah, so, you know, it's a very Niche point because

The inbound should look Anonymous, but the outbound.

Is better personal got it. Okay on that last Slide the the block of text thing. I think what we're trying to convey is basically like

we're trying to show people how how it like

how I guess it like fits into the process how you take what you've got in there and like how it can be used to produce the end result. Yeah.

The one thing I do like from this when I think about how I'd use this.

It's like if I'm super under the gun.

I go. Hey, give me market trends, right?

Then it goes here are the different points.

Right. I could then turn each of these into a slide.

So right you're on your growth 2012 or 7% 2013 is 2%

And then you know, here's a breakdown where watches and Men's Wear.

You know do really badly.

slide to

You know 2012 versus 2013 four different indicators, you know, hello changed slide three, but I wouldn't be able to take this.

And create more than possibly one or two slides in a whole bag.

I think we I think on a conceptual level it seems like the feature is not is is not accurate to how people would like to use it. It seems more like okay, that's fine. I think we need to rethink that.

Yeah.

the

audio for my experience

I didn't capture a need to synthesize a lot of audio. I did a lot of interviews, but I was taking notes with that having said that.

Maybe that's because I didn't have this tool right?

So this tool this audio transcript thing.

Maybe

is extremely useful but for me a first pass is a user who doesn't have this tool.

I don't see it as super useful. Okay, I don't see it super top my agenda. Now. This looks like the sort of thing that if I did use it, it could become incredibly useful.

Okay.

Because a suddenly I wouldn't have to take as many notes. I could focus more in the call afterwards. I could interrogate the outcome great, but maybe I wouldn't end up doing that. I don't know, okay.

Whereas this you know being able to upload loads of loads of shit.

Is great.

Okay, that makes sense. Um

cool. Um, do you feel like you understand what it does?

I think at this point, I think I

let me read it back to you. Then. You'll be able to see if all of those.

I take a load of my data sources that I've gathered. Yeah, a PDF one document.

audio

Bang into Genie

And then I go. Hey Jenny, what's Market greatly like?

and it goes

You know, here's what it's been like here's why whatever or give me a load of notes on this and then it also happily provides sources.

Perfect. Yeah, that's exactly it.

Okay, nice and you?

do you feel like

do you feel like it's resonating with a pain point that would compel you to see the need for something like this?

I don't feel having read this dramatically compelled to get it. Okay?

I think there is a pain point that we solved here that clearly is a good solution.

if it works as it says

I don't feel dramatically like this is going to change my life.

Yeah, we just don't spend or at least I historically happens man. I haven't done tons of days. I only done like two so

I guess I just don't I don't feel like going through huge blocks of texts.

Was the biggest obstacle the biggest obstacle in that sense was the interviews.

But in a sense you're burning most of that time being there with you.

You know.

With the guy you're interviewing.

And there is a Time loss.

Of like synthesizing and doing notes and stuff.

But I don't know. I don't know the extent to which this is like a lack of familiarity with the tool. You know what I mean? It's one of those but it's like

in the same way. So this this reminds me a lot of chat gp2 right like

Alright come out and I like wow. What an amazing tool AI has taken a huge step forward.

And I spend like an hour being like wow asking questions and then I'm like great. That's it. Okay, and I don't bother with my job doing it. Yeah hardly because to be honest.

I'm just not used to it. It's like one of these old people who still are adding things up with pens and paper. Yeah. I haven't figured out that my account. My phone has a calculator. I haven't built it when mental model of artwork and

So I don't I think it would take some adjustment.

for me to actually

benefit

because

like we can't be gbj. I know this value to be added like I write memos and stuff, but I haven't figured out how to actually

build it into my process. That would give me any value out. So in the same way like I see Genie and I'm like that's an incredible solution.

What's the problem I can see parallel to my problems?

But it's a bit.

Which I know socks is an answer in the sense of like.

You know, I'm sure this is what we all said before the iPhone.

Yeah, just cool flashing phone.

and I know the in a sense being able to use my like touch a touch screen and have apps would be a sense useful but like

Mmm, okay, it sort of customer education or adjustment piece.

Yeah.

I guess like I think we're trying to I suppose that's the kind of idea that.

The last thing to some extent right all kind of the one that I think the one we sort of the one the one we're kind of testing won't release this idea of like it's that line where it's like add an extra member to your team. Like do you want to know that analyst on every project basically? Yeah.

Did you run by the way did you talk to there was a German guy New Year's?

Which one?

I don't remember his name.

but

he's a private Equity Consulting.

Analyst. Okay, that's wondering if you met him and talk to him because he would be bang on exactly the target audience. Do you think that

It's all he does all day.

Okay do is so as part of the would you say that part of the response here is?

directed by the fact that the majority of the work you were doing was not due diligence or

yeah, I'm probably helps. Okay, that's for

Okay, interesting. Um

Got it. What most of the projects you were doing?

So it's been a long time doing PPE supply chain stuff. Yeah, no.

this is the government during the private thing like

That was a lot of like data stuff figuring out what we needed doing to be fair quite a few customer interviews with like doctors and staff to be like, what do you use? Like, what do you use it? It's kind of patient what that you know that sort of thing and then like a lot of like financial and not Financial not clearly non Financial modeling about like how many people use how many coming in that's okay. So, how do you buy?

Whilst did a big like a load of these like?

Shitty forward planning things like supporting companies build a budget next year that is just like garbage work.

Of course does work quantitative?

Yeah, it's quite positive.

But also interviewing a lot of people right see what they loved up to and

I'll just go now and

yeah, like building an app for like a retail buying Professor thing, which was a lot of like design that stuff.

Yeah.

Okay.

One thing I think it's a lot of fun though. It was interesting was like if you do a cool, right, then you shouldn't have to listen back to it.

Yeah, I think that's I think that's the biggest and clearest like

the clearest like use point the cover like a huge amount of stuff.

Is like can I?

Have a plugin that goes on all of my calls.

That takes the notes.

You know what? I mean? Like it takes all the notes.

and it

stays there and summarize this thing for me and I can interrogate it.

Have you tried otter?

You know, that's basically what they do. They're used to work in this office.

Oh, yeah.

I'm super cool.

I've got a dash. I've got a half bath. Oh, yeah, no worries. Um,

Yeah, thanks for the feedback though. I will go how to take another half an hour next week or anything like yeah sure. We're gonna iterate and I'll come back to you with a few things and let me come back, you know around awesome and I'll see you tomorrow stunning. Yes you tomorrow.

Kyrie hey
