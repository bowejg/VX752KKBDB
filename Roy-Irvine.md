on the founders genie.

0:02
This is my colleague Alex, we both welcome the products and growth side of things.

0:07
there's a bit of background about the company we got going about sort of 2, 2.5 years ago and we kind of working in the sort of space applying ai to improve research.

0:20
We built one product already which was aimed at academics for summarizing academic papers to speed up literature review.

0:27
And through the process of kind of doing a lot of product research there.

0:30
We got quite interested in like qualitative techniques and user research and the kind of Associated Associated studies around that.

0:41
And so we've been sort of looking at ways in which we might be able to speed up or not speed up and improve qualitative research.

0:50
And so we've been speaking to a number of different independent consultants, we've been in touch with I C G and A Q R and L.

0:58
Are A about that and we've been lucky enough to chat to a few independence now and so yeah, we were basically we're kind of early stage, we have a bit of a prototype and you know, we've been getting some feedback on that, but also kind of continuing to explore associated problems and areas for for for improvement really.

1:18
And so the idea of the call really was just to kind of understand a bit more about about your research and then ask you a few questions that we've been trying to answer ourselves and sort of see what you think.

1:27
Yeah, that's fine if I can help, brilliant.

1:32
so I guess like off the bat would be helpful to just kind of understand a bit more like what sort of area of research are involved in and what types of studies you do and and and kind of how you go about them.

1:44
Sure, so excuse me beg your pardon?

1:47
So obviously I used to be in a massive agency, used to be with Savant Future thinking, Savant to and then I started made you think, which is a kind of micro agency, so there are just a few of us but we work with a really big network and we do, I would say I do a mixture of a few, I would probably say about like 20% just freelancing kind of stuff, running training sessions, all of that kind of stuff and the rest is working on projects and they're either directly for clients, so they might be direct for a client like say well or night frank, which is working with at the moment, Goldman Sachs, people like that who might work directly with them and that can be anything from like for example, the work we're doing with Knight frank at the moment is with high net worth looking at their kind of publishing, you know what kind of they want, publishing magazines, particularly interiors magazines because they're developing their own title and that's been a mixture of online community and depth interviews for that.

2:48
but then I also do a lot of work with metrics lab, which is a really big, you probably know them really massive quant agency and they don't really have a qual capability, certainly within the UK, but I've worked with them over the last four years to really kind of almost like take on a lot of their coal work and build their coal work for them.

3:05
So I work as as kind of so I will have a team there, so depending on the project, I'll work with the team, so there'll be a junior, there'll be a project manager, there might be a senior researcher, it depends on the project and it's usually again it's online communities, depths groups, that kind of stuff.

3:24
follow up follow up, so we do some follow up surveys that we send out to people that kind of things.

3:29
So then I'll be working with a team of about four or five people usually, but I'll be leading that team, so vary, so if I'm working with metrics lab or another client called the Wisdom Council, then I will work with their juniors and lead on a project, particularly multinationals, so they're quite often five or six markets for coal.

3:47
and then if I'm working, so one of my clients, my own clients made you think clients is the financial careers and that we do work in four different countries for them.

3:57
and that will be 10 or 12 focus groups and then it'll be depth, sort of community or something on a rebrand for example.

4:03
So yeah, so it's very varied it's kind of a mix.

4:07
It's mostly consumer, but also some B two B as well.

4:10
Does that help you better background?

4:12
Really helpful.

4:13
Thank thank you for that.

4:14
And so I suppose one thing is this kind of like sector agnostic or is it like, particularly in, I know you mentioned Goldman and like it sounded like a kind of branding piece perhaps.

4:28
is that like a kind of a particular area of yours?

4:30
Then I know some folks kind of focus more in on like fast consumer goods or like food and beverage or like for instance.

4:39
So I don't do very much FM CG stuff at all.

4:42
I don't really do much in the way of food or those kind of consumer goods.

4:48
So a lot of the work that I do, only good I do is alcohol.

4:52
So I do and then I contribute to drinks retailing monthly and things like that.

4:56
So I write for them.

4:58
But so, but again, that's more interviewing bartenders about the latest trends in cocktails for a whiskey client or we've been looking at touch point journeys.

5:07
We've been looking at journeys.

5:08
We were looking at post covid socializing in four different countries.

5:12
So we looked at Australia, India Germany and the UK to see like how people are getting back into socializing, what socializing looks like in different markets, although it's for a drinks company.

5:22
And so I suppose coco work on coke and ships, although they're they're big drinks companies.

5:26
The projects that I do are not about the latest flavor of anything.

5:30
So for coke just finished some work around reusable cups, just really understanding how to encourage, which is understanding a market like Germany which is very advanced for sustainability in the UK, which is a bit behind but not as far behind as the UK US for example.

5:45
So looking at how to encourage like what do consumers understand by sustainability, What what are they?

5:51
why would they take a cup of that kind of stuff?

5:54
And then for Schweppes we've been looking at six different countries from brazil to South Africa to Egypt to UK and Romania or looking at how people socialize, how they go out.

6:06
So not at home.

6:07
That balance between self care and being lazy on your couch.

6:11
Like the fine line of how do you get people out of the house when the default position is to lie on your couch.

6:16
And so yeah, so a lot of the work I do is very much it's very much about audiences is about bringing audiences to life.

6:24
It's you know, for one of my big have a lot of finance clients but the kind of stuff they're interested in are like what's the face of what modern retirement look like.

6:33
It's not, here's our here's our pension plan, what does everyone think of it?

6:38
Or like we did for MMG We did a whole thing about a day in the life of a financial advisor.

6:43
Because you know, it's a lot more of that.

6:47
I specialize a lot in publishing content, branding those kinds of areas.

6:53
As well as kind of the only kind of consumer stuff really is Personal care, like beauty products, skin care, hair care.

7:02
But even then for, well we do things like go to speak to hairdressers just to understand again, trends to understand like a lot of contextual stuff.

7:14
And then for dove, we just did some work around women in Saudi Arabia how we and feel approaching puberty.

7:21
So it's very so it's kind of advertising, branding audience lifestyle, bringing audiences to life much more than Let's see what people think of this new rice pouch, that's not my area at all.

7:37
It sounds like you got a ton of experience.

7:39
I'm also always just so interested.

7:42
Kind of going to a few people and heard about these studies and I always think that they're I don't know, like, always just sound kind of fascinating like what what what does that look like?

7:51
And yeah, I mean, wow, okay.

7:53
It's the biggest kind of like, it's the best kept secret career qualitative research.

7:57
I think I do if I do a careers day for, for school, whatever.

8:01
I always just say like it's real, it's a combination of being a bit of a librarian and a bit of a research, like an academic and a researcher as well as being someone who's like in the wings waiting for you because you so often see new stuff before it comes out, especially ad campaigns, I'll inform product development, but I won't probably then test like I mean I've done it, I've done like new bagel testing and that kind of stuff of course.

8:28
But it's more about the bit that comes before that inspires that some extent.

8:33
So much more than here's a financial document.

8:37
Can people understand the first line?

8:39
Yeah.

8:42
It's fascinating.

8:43
Okay.

8:44
And I suppose if we get to like I guess for a bit more context to like double click on one of those like what does, and I guess if it is a tool somewhat repeatable, like what was the process like look like you wouldn't be able to kind of walk us through like an example of I guess from like you know getting getting a proposal, submitted a proposal to someone getting it except to do some work.

9:07
Like how where do you kind of go from there?

9:10
So I'll give you an example, I've got one, I've got one coming up actually that I'm just about set up but it's for Australian client who make shoes.

9:19
And they've been around for a long time.

9:22
And they famous footwear company and they want, they've got a big quantitative survey and they've got these six segments and there's one segment of their audience that is a big segment that they don't understand.

9:34
Which are this kind of active outdoors person, but not necessarily like climbing mountains and whatever it is, but they might cycle to work, they might prefer to be outside, they walk their dog, but they still want to look nice and are willing to spend 160 quid on a pair of boots basically.

9:51
so they want to understand a bit more.

9:54
So my job is to then think about how we approach that.

9:57
So it's in this case we're going to do some some sort of more ethnographic depth.

10:02
So we're gonna spend a bit of time with people.

10:04
So we've decided to spend kind of half a day with each of these people with them actually showing us this, you know, evidence that outdoors and this if you like all this outdoorsy behavior.

10:14
So we'll go to the probably go to the house or meet them out in the park or whatever it is.

10:20
We'll get them to do some work beforehand as well.

10:22
So we want them to create a mood board.

10:24
We want them to create a kind of collage and a mood board about, you know, what being active being outdoors being kind of that kind of focus in their life or kind of being busy, what that means, what that looks like to them, so they have to create a mood board and we won't give them much guidance, we'll let them do that themselves, have them talk us through the mood boards, will meet them at home, look around their house, look in the cupboards, show us your shoes, you know, show us, show us what other brands so we want.

10:48
So we always want to look in context, so I don't want to just see their shoes, I want to see what clothing brands that have, like they're wearing Patagonia, North Face, you know, or are they actually wearing Primark?

10:58
And then they just got this one pair of shoes, you know, are they you know what's in there, washing basket is at the gym clothes from the week or is there nothing in there or what food are they eating, what brands they're buying into?

11:08
So so we have a little tour of the house and then we will probably go outdoors to them for a walk and we'll do like a walk shop, so we'll just go and chat as we go.

11:19
and then we obviously record it, get it transcribed.

11:23
So I work with a really good transcriber, a couple of really good transcribers.

11:26
I prefer human transcription to to ai because I've tried a few of them now and they don't cope with accents very well.

11:34
They also don't cope when you're in a busy environment.

11:36
So if we do in store, if you're doing like for well we go down to they've got all these basically hairdressers by everything from like these holes like a Costco of hairdressers and they're everywhere.

11:49
They are quite noisy.

11:51
But I want to take notes while I never take notes when I'm talking to people because it's a distraction.

11:57
So we recorded we try and get yeah we try and get some much transcript as possible.

12:04
We've got their visual material that we analyzed as well.

12:06
We might ask them to do post task and then it's a case of being a bit kind of analog about it.

12:12
So thematic analysis.

12:14
So we'll get all transcripts in place.

12:17
and then we'll do some thematic analysis.

12:19
So usually so the trans.

12:20
So the way that so this is the way that I look at analysis and it's what I tell clients is that I see analysis as a triple filtered process.

12:26
So there's three filters.

12:28
And the problem with coal is that people who get bad coal clients who comply bad kuo is often because they have had no the analysis has been incomplete and the analysis has stopped at the first filter.

12:41
So the first filter is kind of your what did you think your top of your top of line thoughts just on a focus group feedback to the client what you think it is.

12:50
It's also getting transcripts reading through the transcripts that that's not analysis, that's just a simulation of data and lots of people just, they'll write the report based on that without.

13:01
So then as qual researchers, our job is to take that is to then pull out the themes the second there is a bit of analysis.

13:07
But then we'll also pull in things like any kind of sociology or psychology theories or kind of other contextual information.

13:15
So obviously the big context at the moment is cost of living.

13:19
You know, it was over it now it's cost of living.

13:22
It might be politics might be all of those things like what is the contextual environment that we're in, what other brands doing.

13:27
So it will look more widely to sort of see what's the market.

13:30
And I would say as well actually that we always think the analysis starts from the time that you get the brief so you immediately switch your brain onto like right, I'm really gonna like for coke.

13:42
I'm like obsessed with reusable vessels now.

13:45
You know everywhere I go, I'm taking pictures of people's reusable vessels, incentives to use them at Costco or cost or whatever it is because you're just constantly filling up with that.

13:55
I'll sort of have alerts set to certain companies or things like that.

13:59
So we'll add that will be our second stage.

14:00
So well analyze the transcripts will do some, some analysis of that.

14:04
Pull out some of the key themes, adding any kind of theories that we think.

14:08
Think about the contextual stuff.

14:10
Think about what else we've learned and then the last stage is kind of what kind of distilling it down to 4 to 8 key like talking points.

14:17
So what are what are the key 4 to 8 things that have come out of this, that what have we thought about it?

14:23
And then we kind of right around then we write the debrief around those themes so it's so it's quite deep.

14:29
So that process of analysis, analysis is the most important stage.

14:33
Yeah.

14:35
When you say like bad, bad qualitative research like what I suppose like read between the lines that it kind of sounds like sort of suggesting that's like when it's a bit like superficial or it's you but it was like a sort of aggregation of just sort of information It's a little bit so so when clients have been burned in a qualitatively, you know sometimes we have to unpick a lot of damage done.

15:04
When people have been burned, they've been sold on a methodology and not the outcome.

15:08
So they've been, it's been all about, we're gonna do focus clients know what a focus group or depth is, they don't need 27 pages of proposal.

15:15
Talk about how you're going to recruit people.

15:18
So there's usually some sort of poor recruitment as part of it is probably some moderation which has been kind of pretty superficial and not digging deep enough, but the main thing that's missing is is the kind of thought and the contextual thought and the additional thought and the added value that you have and also like not being connected to what the business objectives of the clients or it's no good reporting that you cannot report back what people said, That's not cool.

15:44
And unfortunately coal is something that people think is quite easy and it's simply a case of gathering information, saying, well consumers said you need to advertise this, it's not practical to suggest that, you know, it's not practical and it's it's the kind of knowing to interpret what people are saying versus what that leads you to think and always try and tell people like sometimes people can can do very bad calling and they're not prepared to make have an opinion.

16:08
So you see coal projects coal coal decks that are just full of the bay Tums, you know, you really need one or two verbatim that are really amazing that bring something to life.

16:18
It's better that you do that and that you you don't use your verbatim as a kind of, it's just a collection of verbatim to kind of make your point that you want to make.

16:28
So it's hard, it's hard work to do analysis and I think so I think clients are dissatisfied because they'll say things like, well, but we spend millions on advertising and now you're coming to me and saying that we need to advertise more or we need to like, for example, this is this is the this is the magazine I've been working on with the night frank.

16:49
So it's it's not branded.

16:50
It looks very cool, very modern, very modern house.

16:54
Only branding is a little bit on the back that no one noticed, and then there's a tiny bit at the bottom of every page which says kind of from Knight frank.

17:05
Okay, so people were like, so, so, so if I had just taken some of the things people said at face value, I would have gone back and said, what you need to do is slap your brand all over this is because people don't know where it's from.

17:16
But actually we know that's a virtue.

17:17
We know that's what separates it from other from from their competitor, which is probably got rid of.

17:24
Now who has got their brand symbols have got their brand.

17:27
It's it's gold, it's glossy, it's not it's not this.

17:31
And when people say things like, oh, the text is a bit small, what it is is a disengagement.

17:37
The text is not too small.

17:38
It's no smaller than if you step back, it's no smaller than you would get in a letter in the post.

17:43
What it is is a disengagement with the content really.

17:47
You know, it's a disengagement of the content and it's things like this where no one actually knows what the heading of this article is about because it's sort of lost a bit here.

17:56
It's higgledy piggledy and you can't see it.

17:58
That's what it's about or it's about things like it's like that is a waste of that is a waste, it's all about re wilding which have a really visual cue to it.

18:10
You know, we know that we have similar information visually so it should so for a reader's point of view that's a waste of space and it looks like small, you could have made that bigger text, what you could have done is made it more engaging with some images or links or people's instagram handles or something.

18:24
So it sounds like, I suppose the way you're characterizing is like there's a in the good work, there's a good qualitative work, there's a kind of really there's like a very original contribution beyond a sort of representation of the data and and something that almost points more towards like a more of a practical strategy in an outcome.

18:49
I think I think what it is is so when so when I do I do quite a lot of coal training, especially people who don't do a lot of coal or quant people who found themselves in a position where they need to do because there are some cold methodologies out there and people who don't normally write qualified it very terrifying to analyze and write quote because they are terrified that they are putting words in people's mouths or that they are lying.

19:12
You know, I've had real junior quantities who want to do with the quality and have worked with me on projects who have really had to kind of push to have an opinion and and call is about your having an opinion, but you're having an opinion on the, on the bedrock of that is all the analysis and the knowledge and the information you have.

19:31
Just because someone didn't say I've just engaged with this content.

19:34
That's why I don't like the font.

19:36
It doesn't need to say that it needs us to understand that that's what they're saying when we take it in the round.

19:43
Because if I just did a whole slide all about other fonts, could you make it a bigger size?

19:48
Nor is the fact that actually what it is is the paper quality, The paper color wasn't very good and nobody wants to read it because they couldn't see what the picture was.

19:58
So, it's, there's a big difference between reporting and kind of debriefing.

20:06
I noticed that you mentioned the significance of like secondary contextual information as part of your project timeline.

20:13
Do you, do you dedicate time on a project by project basis to, collect and gather secondary contextual information or is that something that you guys have just experienced through working on multiple projects.

20:26
Probably a bit of both.

20:27
I think it depends on the topic.

20:29
So, you know, I have my trusty, my favorite psychology book, which is the, you know, it's sort of, it's a big, it's a series called Big Ideas, simply explained.

20:42
and there's a politics, There's one for every subject you can imagine.

20:46
and this one is quite a good little sometimes it's just a good little thought process.

20:51
Other times I'll actually reach out and try and find like, so when I was doing the switch one all about like that line between being social and wanting self care and all the rest of it, I had a sociologist because I just didn't understand this whole concept of being born social.

21:07
So I just want to have a conversation with someone.

21:11
I think that as I said, it's it's partly embedded behavior because you know, I'm working on it and it's very difficult if you're working on five or six projects.

21:19
But you start, so you find that you start to have conversations or you start to like, as I said, notice people's reusable cups and you start to have informal conversations with them.

21:29
I don't think in the analysis process you think I've done this step now I'm gonna see what this means?

21:34
I'd actually say that the process of thinking like I wonder what this kind of behavior is sometimes comes at the writing phase when you're trying to take the analysis and try and like, okay, so now putting on paper, what does it mean?

21:48
I wonder if it's really sparkly curious all the time while researchers are curious all the time.

21:56
How do you, how do you demonstrate that value to a client?

22:00
Like will you cite these sources or how do you kind of show that it's not bad, it's not superficial, You know, you're thinking about this broader context partly.

22:10
I think it's experience and the way you presented so that you are, you know that it's partly about the kind of the way you put your debrief together the way you So I always flat plan mine.

22:20
So I take the same concept that I do with like a magazine.

22:26
You know, I plan it out.

22:28
I don't, I'm a great believer in paper and pen before power point, you know, and that's just not having a ton of post it notes.

22:35
That's just kind of what's the shape of this look like.

22:38
So what's the shape of it?

22:39
I know where it's going, I know where there's gonna be something.

22:41
So if I'm gonna reference, so I did a project for drink away which is about some app they wanted to launch where you could compare your drinking to people your who were the same like your age or whatever it is.

22:53
And so we talked about the kind of concept of social comparison.

22:57
So upward and downward social comparison.

22:59
So what is the motivation for someone to use this app?

23:02
Either to say that you're better than someone else or to say that your life is not as bad as there's so like what, but you know, like are you gonna take advantage of that and sort of allow people to compare themselves to feel better than others or worse than others?

23:15
And then what are the consequences?

23:16
So we do talk about those sort of theories, but I think it's a little bit sort of running through, you know, I'm not, I'm not a sociologist, I'm not a clinical psychologist or anything like that.

23:28
I can only talk about behavior and what it references.

23:32
Okay.

23:33
And supposedly like when you're doing this process, how how do you, what sort of steps would you say?

23:42
sort of, how do you go above and beyond?

23:46
Really set yourself apart?

23:47
Like what are the steps you take to kind of really maximize that like quality, but then also within the constraint of being punctual too and submitted on time the work.

23:56
Like how do you kind of what?

23:59
Yeah, so first of all I think that it is about, there's two things.

24:04
One is that coal can be seen as very indulgent.

24:06
It can see it's like a very luxurious timeline taking 10 weeks to do something or all this kind of, you know, it can take a long time.

24:12
So we try and do two things replied.

24:15
So one is that we try and you're kind of morning after the night before.

24:19
So we've done the groups, you've done whatever it is and this is our instant feedback.

24:22
And I would say, you know, without a percentage on it in a large percentage of time, a considered analysis actually backs up what we thought initially, but with with a bit more depth and detail so that people don't feel like they're left behind.

24:36
And I know there's a lot of pressure to make coal faster and it is possible to make coal faster doesn't always have to be language thinking and stuff, but it works very well if you're testing a new Wasabi sauce, you know, or you've got a product development process or something that who should be put on the cover of a magazine when it's something more strategic, you just have to allow that thoughts and you have to just train your client to understand that this is gonna take time but but but I think you I think the problem is looking at things in distinct buckets, they're not distinct.

25:05
So analysis starts when you get the brief and you start to be tuned into the project, the way that you write the discussion guide is thinking about how the presentation is going to look.

25:14
So you think right, the reason I'm asking doing this exercise is completely brilliant visually, I know that it's gonna be great because we can like, let's say one we did about people's relationship with coffee, we got them to draw a timeline from their first Milky coffee trying to be in the friends, like pretend their own friends to drinking double espressos now, like we looked at kind of what they were drinking, to what they're drinking now emotionally and the product that's great, you know, and not just the one with retirement who got people to draw a timeline of retirement and we could put people's hand written notes into the debrief and we could show, you know, people going to de clutter their wardrobes apparently, and then volunteer and then maybe they'd take up retirement.

25:55
So, so again, so you're you're kind of always thinking like, like if you imagine it like a series of, remember, like we used to learn maths and you have to have those little what they call the little the number line line.

26:08
So it's like I see it in my head like a number line and fieldwork is this teeny teeny teeny little, like number five on a scale of 1 to 10, it looks like one little block.

26:16
So when you're doing everything, you're always working to it.

26:20
I think it's a mistake to think about, right, okay, now it's analysis time.

26:24
Everybody, let's do the three days that we've allowed for analysis.

26:28
Now, it's writing time, let's do it kind of overlaps and I think it's about because the more the better your analysis, the better your debrief, the quicker your debrief will be to write the debrief is really about the analysis is the more muddled your analysis more difficult.

26:45
Your debrief is going to be to write your debrief is really just all you're thinking, everything has to happen first and then you put it on paper and that's what I think is that I think when you get that bad quality spoke about is when people have rushed to get start writing stuff, get that power point opened up, start slapping stuff on, it just becomes a mess.

27:06
So the analysis is constant.

27:10
The writing is constantly thinking about how that's gonna look in the debris for what the structure is gonna be.

27:14
It's just a constant.

27:16
I think it's a much more integrated process than people.

27:18
So where people come unstuck here saying I've only allowed two hours, two days for analysis and I'm trying to do it in these hours are available.

27:27
So whenever I'm doing training always tell people like you need a minimum of three hour chunks with nothing else happening for analysis gets into it.

27:37
So we actually spoke to a bunch of management consultants as well at one point.

27:42
And one thing that's kind of common then I wonder if I wonder if this is similar for your into your experience as well is to they'll often build a skeleton of like the deck very quickly and early on and then a lot of time is just spent basically refining it.

27:59
and so it's this like iterative working document.

28:02
Is that similar for you as well.

28:04
Do you have like a kind of working document that is like you know iterative li refined and built up towards this sort of masterpiece or is it like a it's probably a little bit different.

28:14
I mean I see where they're coming from I think so I quantities are able to do that as well because people can work with numbers because they can template it almost and they kind of got their data in, I don't know what the story.

28:25
So so one thing I'm really fascinated by is how people write books.

28:29
So how authors write books and whenever I go to quite a lot of author talks and I'm always fascinated by how they say like I don't know what this character was gonna do and like how can you not know you wrote the bloody book, you're the person who knows the shape of the story, you know the arc of the story, How can that character surprised you by suddenly behaving in this way?

28:47
But it's absolutely true.

28:49
You know, I can be writing a presentation with a very clear view and then I don't know, it's just can certainly think it actually this goes here or the slots here or you know, you can you can you can be surprised by your own findings with your own thoughts as you go along.

29:04
I mean the only so after I've done the analysis, I just said do you make a flat plan.

29:10
So I do like plan out, right, these are the sections, this is roughly what's in the sections and I will draw many charts as well.

29:18
So, you know, I'll draw like I'll do a lot of sketching in terms of this actually could be you know, just some pictures And some words, this could be a word cloud, this could be a kind of arrow with this, this is going to have to be text, so I don't stick to it rigidly.

29:35
But I know that I know the direction I'm going in because because Cole can make a very waffle otherwise, you know, and I love a 30 page limit depending on the on the project.

29:45
And then I also have a structure that I always do.

29:47
So I always I have to break it into chapters.

29:52
Beginning of chapter.

29:52
There's always three key points.

29:54
So I go on the basis that people don't have time to read debriefs only read headlines.

29:58
So everything is the whole story is in the headline.

30:01
I don't do recommendations at the end, I do them throughout.

30:05
So they call out boxes throughout on every slide, saying what this means.

30:08
And then I will collect them at the end.

30:09
But you know, people aren't waiting for a big reveal and you kind of mentioned a few times, like talk about like PowerPoint pens and paper.

30:20
Like do you use any other tools, a tool during this process.

30:24
There are lots of software things out there like dovetail rain and they that something never tried or haven't look I haven't tried them.

30:32
I probably I mean it's funny enough I went of course to check GPT.

30:36
Was that the one that mike did?

30:39
Yeah everyone's wondering.

30:40
We had a big thing on the A.

30:41
Q.

30:41
R.

30:41
Yesterday about how like and we should see it like augmented to humans rather than replacing humans and obviously not learning anything factual by the sounds of things but it could be useful as an extra seat at the brainstorming table.

30:56
You know that's the kind of way I see it is or I think someone said when it's six p.m. At night you still got a discussion guide to write.

31:03
You can't think of any kind of ideas of tasks for people with electric cars.

31:07
It might spark something off.

31:09
And it's the same way I think about analysis and everything.

31:11
Sometimes you can do all the research and one person says one thing for a minute and it unlocks everything else.

31:18
And I think that's my, so where I've looked at these things before and obviously use things like collective the online community platform I prefer which can do a certain amount of collation of data.

31:30
Rather I think the problem is they missed soldiers analysis tools and they're not the data collection tools they kind of pull out some key themes.

31:38
Someone did say they've used chat chat Gpt to analyze and pull out key themes but how you then use that to write, it's like trying to my concern is that if I'm not in bed, if I'm not integrated in the data and analyzing, I don't analyze everything.

31:57
But if at least the first flush of analysis isn't done where someone's pulling pulling out key themes or quotes.

32:03
If I'm not involved to some extent, it's very difficult to write someone else's presentation really that you haven't written.

32:11
Yeah, we've heard that a few times.

32:12
One guy we spoke to put it quite succinctly and was kind of like, you know, with these tools I I want like a co pilot and the captain, I want ownership of the process and that's interesting.

32:25
Yeah, I think so.

32:27
Where something like that could come in handy at the moment, I'm using humans for it.

32:31
So I have people who work with me and I'll say can you do some analysis on or start to do some kind of analysis on the online community.

32:39
And I'm sure you've seen recollected recollected recollected.

32:46
So that's the call, that's the best online community for coal communities because it's designed it's not quant that they've tried to make quality specifically designed for qualitative research, But it produces, you know, you have 40 people on there for three or four days answering questions and doing tasks, making videos, doing all that kind of stuff and it produces an unimaginable amount of data in massive and if you don't keep up with it as it's coming in, you'll lose control of it and you'll end up with a week's worth of having to sit in front of your computer and go through read everything that everyone said and it can, it can, it can produce work clouds and do a few other things that give you a sense of it.

33:28
But essentially I have to get like a research assistant to basically follow as I'm moderating sort of come behind me and start marking stuff.

33:38
It's not even that great at highlighting text to be honest or saving excesses.

33:43
So those things are extremely irritating.

33:45
Yeah, I've seen a few, I've seen, I saw another one similar one called prolific, I think it's the same similar thing where it's sort of specifically for that data collection and concept testing and that sort of thing.

33:58
Okay, have you come across some dovetail?

34:04
This is one we've, I mean they've they've kind of been around for a while and they have a very sort of seemingly impressive number of, you know, different different companies, you've like signed up to that website real quick dovetail.

34:23
and one thing where like huge brands tons of companies using this thing allegedly you know, all these people from, from NHS, but I we haven't, I don't think we found any, I don't think we've actually managed to find anyone except for some other people in the startup community who really who really used it.

34:51
And it's a sort of what it's for essentially aggregating and then and then tagging and writing reports on, you know on on on projects.

35:04
So you can kind of have all of your insights sort of loaded up here and then you can, you know, you can kind of go through and tag various bits and organize them and and write write your report directly in the you know into it as well.

35:21
And then and then on top of that you can kind of search all of it and like share this with your organization you know, help people use the data.

35:31
So so what they're saying that these companies are using this and and so where where is this coming from?

35:37
Is this coming from like consumers recruit recruited bespoke for this project or is this just like scraping the internet like taking off trust pilot and because this looks like reviews to me of blend of.

35:51
So this is that the demo, it's basically it basically connects to your, you know, you're you're like survey to like type form or whatever.

36:00
You can upload audio and video to it.

36:02
You documents, you can connect it to your like customer support as well.

36:08
So it tries to sort of drag everything into one place, making sort of indexed and searchable but and it sort of seems to be like somewhat popular amongst you know, sort of product teams in tech and that kinda thing, but we haven't found anyone specifically doing quote who's like hugely reliant on this or at least another way of looking at is they haven't at least gone out of their way to find it for want of needing it, I suppose.

36:34
I don't know where I would come in though because I think the difficulty with qualities that well because, because quality is generally spoken ad hoc and it's answering a specific objective, I think that there's not that much, not franchised syndicate, there's not that much syndicated quo.

36:51
There are obviously some open ends on the end of quant stuff or there's omnibus is, but there's shared, shared amongst.

36:59
So either shared among or for example, So we used to do someone else's future thinking or we used to do something for the BBC called the People's Panel and we recruited something like 400 people and every 6 to 8 weeks we ran eight groups for them and different parts of BBC would use that to ask questions.

37:15
So you'll be doing a two hour group and you have like 10 minutes on Radio Four and, and kind of like 20 minutes on Newsnight.

37:22
And here's a new trail, you know, so that that's kind of almost like a qualitative omnibus was a regular piece of work.

37:29
And so there are those kind of jobs, but most qual is relatively bespoke.

37:35
And so it's either on its own or it might be like some work I'm doing now is feeding into the development of Quantum survey.

37:40
So it's before they write the concert and they need to do some soul to get some language stuff.

37:46
So I guess something like this, I mean, I don't know what this is.

37:49
I have a limited understanding.

37:50
I think this is all very interesting and I can see how it could write a generic and general interest report on a topic like airline seats or comfort in airlines or premium economy, whatever this is versus an airline coming to us and saying, you know, we want to understand people's journey from beginning to end or we or we want to know like we're thinking about changing our I don't know, thinking about changing the color of the leather on our seats or imposing a kind of, okay, I want to ask her.

38:37
She seems very clued up.

38:38
Yeah, I want to ask her what she actually asked her research assistants to do.

38:43
Yeah.

38:54
Yeah.

38:55
Like she's super smart.

39:00
Hello Carrie.

39:07
She's definitely like presented a much more thorough and deeper process than most of these guys.

39:14
I feel like some of them would like her and that guy Simon, they're kind of killer.

39:18
They're like, they're really like they're like, yeah, they kind of they seem like thought leaders in the space and it's funny what she described as bad kuo is kind of what a lot of people have presented to us as like their process.

39:32
Yeah, literally.

39:35
Yeah.

39:38
I don't think that many people have spoken seriously about like secondary contextual information as a basis or framework for their analysis.

39:48
Yeah, it's making me question wording.

39:51
I think maybe we should go read some books about how people do this as well.

39:56
Hello?

39:57
Hello.

39:58
Hi.

39:59
Sorry about that.

40:00
No worries, no worries.

40:01
It might be something on our end.

40:02
You know, I think there's bloody Windows 11 keeps my windows since Windows 11 upgrade or something on this laptop.

40:12
It's just this laptop in particular it seems to just occasionally crash when I'm using videos.

40:18
Using video so it's supposed to be with the drivers or something.

40:22
Anyway, never mind if I go again, I'll join from a different laptop if it's a problem.

40:25
Sure.

40:28
One thing that I was just interested in asking earlier in the Cool, you mentioned how occasionally when you're dealing with large amounts of data, you have to bring in a research assistant to kind of help you out with that.

40:41
It's quite interesting for us because building a tool in this space, we're almost trying to position ourselves as potentially a research assistant for someone like yourself.

40:50
So I was just interested in understanding what, you know, what would be some typical tasks or if there was a recent project that you worked with a research assistant, what what sort of things you actually asked them to do to help you.

41:01
So if I'm working with a junior or research assistant, it can be anything from, they might write the first draft of things like a recruitment screener or a discussion guide for me to have a look at.

41:11
So depending on, you know, if they've been brief, you know, they get involved in the briefing, that kind of thing.

41:16
So they might write that, they might actually do some of the interviews or they might do some of the moderating.

41:23
So or that you know, even if it's kind of behind the scenes moderating, but then the biggest thing that I need help with is often kind of that first batch is going through the time taken to go through all the data.

41:33
So I quite often work with another couple of freelancers or some freelancers or some research assistants, like these objectives is what you're looking out for, but I need you just to cut this data down for me themes and chunks and so so normally and again it's it's quite analog so that let's say it's an online community and we've got the topic was all about like flavor like like drink, you know, going out and going out socializing in the kind of drinks and so whether you drink and eating that kind of stuff.

42:05
they will almost note down, they look at different industry, male and female, younger, older where they are in spain or wherever it is if we're doing that market.

42:14
And then it's almost kind of having to take that data and move it into move into kind of section.

42:20
So this section is all about before you go to a venue, how you feel, feel what you're wearing and how you're feeling, what resources you use, where your inspiration comes from.

42:29
So those kind of themes down the side who's saying what and then the next thing might be about once you're in the your first moments in the venue.

42:37
Okay, how are you feeling?

42:38
What are you seeing, who's involved, What kind of questions do you have?

42:42
And then we would have that and then I'd want them to then say, okay, I've looked at all of this stuff and actually my thinking, you know, like my summary, top line summary at the top of this block of text is looking at all of this like this is a real one.

42:56
But like we looked at how people feel about going out after Covid and we could see the Australians were much more nervous because and so and that's also because they had more seated.

43:07
You know, they were all wanting to sort of be set set, they didn't want to approach a bar, but they were able to be outside.

43:12
So they weren't scared of Covid, whereas in India we saw people were really hedonistic and wanted a party and but women were really afraid.

43:20
Like women really conscious of how it appeared for them to be out drinking and who they went with them.

43:23
What bar.

43:24
So their consideration before then you is all about safety parking reassurance.

43:29
Is it acceptable for me to be here?

43:30
Who can I go with?

43:31
So that only comes you don't you don't see that until you've kind of taken the big big data, taken it down to slightly smaller, arrange thematic data and then you step back and say, okay, what does all this mean?

43:45
What we're hearing?

43:46
So if we ask people to describe in this particular project, we got them to go on a night out and report back to us throughout.

43:53
And we looked at all the words they used, you know, all the descriptors they used and you could see like the indian words were arranged from like party celebration, treat, indulgence orders, but also like fear concern ethics, whatever it is and we could then put them together.

44:12
So yeah, it's a kind of So what I use a kind of freelancer for or research assistant for is to do that middle stage to take all the big amount of data, take it down to a smaller amount, put it into themes and then together we'll kind of okay, what does it mean?

44:26
It's always like I suppose for when you're when you're analyzing these things like it's almost about it feels like it's almost about fitting into the context of like working memory to be able to like see those connections that you wouldn't have the whole lot together.

44:41
Yeah I mean some companies divide it up so some companies will will have a couple of people.

44:46
So we've had this before.

44:48
It's less successful in my view.

44:50
So there's two different so you're doing six countries, you might say right each person take a country and just analyze that country And then we'll try and you can then be an owner of that country and supposedly you have deep knowledge of that country and you can bring it all together when you write the presentation or you might say right you analyze day one of the community which is all about what's in your drinks cabinet.

45:10
I'll do day two it's very disconnected.

45:12
So it's so if you've got a if you're short on time and you're an agency, the thing is the big agencies cost analysis out.

45:21
They don't do analysis.

45:23
And that's one of the reason why my company called made you think is precisely that because I got incredibly frustrated with having to cost out my any time I had for analysis was costed out it's too expensive to just look like you're sitting and thinking right and to to kind of understand it more is that because there's like a perception from the client that So the client it's your it's your internal pressures.

45:49
So the internal pressures on costs and you will have a margin.

45:51
So so your agency or your CFO or whatever it is.

45:55
We'll say right, the margin that you have to make on call projects is say 60% we need to make 60% gross margin.

46:03
The only way that you can do that is by cutting the amount of time that you spend on the project.

46:07
Because there are fixed costs, like recruitment, incentives, venue hire travel, you're gonna cut your cost by using a junior who's got a cheaper day rate or you're going to say actually we can only have one day's analysis, like that's that's never enough, you know?

46:21
And even then that one day we'll get chipped at bye.

46:24
Oh, there's this meeting or could you write a proposal?

46:27
Could you go and do this?

46:28
So it's never it's never sacred.

46:30
It's not seen it's not valued by big agencies and it's it's not it's not obviously working time in some ways, Although you're doing analysis there is this perception by non qualities and by finance people who are looking at margins that in reality, you know, you need five days, let's say it's a project which does need five days, the maximum you might be allowed to cost for.

46:54
It is 1 1.5 days because you're under a huge amount of pressure to bring that down because that's tying people up and you don't have the head count.

47:02
You don't want to pay for a freelancer and you and you also, it's it's it's just something that, you know, gets cost gets costed out to the to the detriment of good kuo Yeah, yeah.

47:15
We've heard that we heard that a lot from the management consultants to like scope creep and the battle for margin in in consulting.

47:21
I mean, it's a business, right?

47:22
Where the product is, the product is the is the is offered by the, you know, the people in their time, right?

47:27
You know, they're they're highly trained to do something.

47:29
And so that tends to be the sort of that that that suffers because people just assume that your raw materials kind of cost what they do, and those are negotiable and and I think I think the other issue is the way that quality is often costed or described in proposals.

47:45
So it'll be like, say, six groups, and it'll it'll be, you know, £18,000 or six groups.

47:50
That gives you the perception that it's it's kind of six groups.

47:54
Each group is costing kind of, you know, £3000.

47:57
Like how on earth can it cost eight people in the room?

47:59
How on earth can it cost £3000.

48:01
But as I said, it's a tiny little dot project line.

48:04
And I think we so I try not to talk about methodology.

48:07
When I'm costing, I tried to talk about kind of what what the service includes analysis including dB fright, including time spent thinking processing project management, because because I think that then it cheapens that people think, well, you know, that's where it begins and ends, just some people turned up and we ask questions on the topic, looking at larger organizations, one of the things we wanted.

48:37
So we've had we've had heard a few sort of insights from independent people and you kind of alluded to earlier about talking about sort of syndication and you know, should you dovetail that sort of thing?

48:47
how how does the other than that, I suppose on this like front of like margins and scaling up scaling up the process, like how does it tend to differ when you get to a bigger organization?

48:59
Because for us, like we're, you know, we're interested basically in in seeing what, you know, whether there's an opportunity here for us to you know, build, build a valuable tool and one things we're conscious of is so far we've only really spoken to a lot of independent or kind of micro agencies and so we wanna we kind of want to we want to develop some certainty that or at least some understanding of whether things we find out our representative of like the wider market to that we have been observing for instance.

49:32
I think the bigger the bigger so I work with a really big work metrics leverages big quantum agency, but obviously I'm very conscious that there are global, you know, that we have in many countries and I'm very conscious through them of things like so the costing, what happened is that the costing for the project, the preparation, the proposal, all of that kind of stuff is separated away from the research.

49:53
The research often has no influence on how our project is costed.

49:58
So in some agencies, some of the big agencies, you have sales teams that sell the project, cost the project all that kind of stuff, but don't actually do the work and I don't know how long the work is gonna take.

50:11
So and there's often not a lot of communication between those two.

50:14
So your account managers and other agencies, you might have account managers and this is very much how it was in future thinking Samantha as well.

50:20
So you've got this kind of organization where you have monkeys, monkeys and organ grinders to some extent, although they hate that kind of, they really hate that crypto, but if that's what it boils down to.

50:32
So you know, you've got people who are selling, you know, selling these things without, first of all.

50:38
So one of the frustrations is they don't consult call and then they would come to when I was head of quality future thinking they'd say, oh yeah, we've we've won this project since 50 depth, it's gonna need to be done in three weeks.

50:48
So okay by here you are and make that happen.

50:52
So what, you know what the hell I can't make, how can involvement 50 deaths, no one can do, you know, it's just that there's no, there's not a lot of the thinking is, but just jointed.

51:03
So, so procurement, finance sourcing whatever it is called in your big company are looking for to hit a margin target.

51:13
And often, and I would say that if they are a big agency that does call inc want their finance system will be developed from a quant point of view, which is very easy to kind of to cost per person, cost, per interview.

51:25
And it will not be adapted for quote very well.

51:27
So we used to have a system of future thinking called, I want to call it papaya, but I don't think it's called papaya.

51:34
It's got some name like that.

51:35
But anyway, where we literally had like cost planning to, but it wasn't, it was, it was constantly on about this cradle to grave thing.

51:44
So you could put your time teach time sheet in, you could do all these other things.

51:48
But when it came to quo, we literally had to sit with a calculator and just fiddle the margins until we could get the machine to accept what we were saying, even though that's not the reality of what we actually did.

51:58
So you had to, because it just wasn't, it's wonky, it's not designed.

52:02
So, and the people who are now often at the C suite level haven't done are not from a research background.

52:08
So they haven't worked in research, they certainly haven't worked at the coalface of coal.

52:12
They don't really, and especially if it's a it's a big agency owned by private equity, private equity is not really interested in what you're doing, is not interested in the work.

52:23
The value of the work, as you probably know with any p it's kind of quite frankly, you could be selling tomato juice out the back door to make up your margins.

52:30
They don't really care and then head count is is what they start.

52:34
So it's all very very very distant from the kind of experience of what you're delivering your clients, clients don't necessarily feel this.

52:41
But yeah, so you're under.

52:43
So the people who are selling the projects, the people who are bringing projects into big agencies, people who are costing it are completely disconnected from the delivery.

52:51
And so anything that they can anything that can be automated or done quickly or sent to another country that's cheaper.

53:00
Any of that kind of stuff that can be moved away is the win.

53:05
But the quality might be affected.

53:09
For example, as a quick example, so one of the when I was before I left future thinking they decided to get rid of the we had an in house field qualitative field team of three people and they decided to get rid of them and give all of the work to acumen fieldwork they were called.

53:24
So to give everything to acumen.

53:25
Fieldwork and acumen, we're going to write the recruitment screeners which meant that we wouldn't as researchers have to write the recruitment screens, which would theoretically give us back some time because the cheaper company would be writing those screeners, the reality was is they really shocking Screeners, we had to spend time briefing them so they could write a half half baked screener which we would then have to rewrite and then it would be and then we had no closeness to the recruiters because it was all done through this big agency.

53:52
So it was but it costs less on paper.

53:55
Didn't matter that it was cost more of our time.

53:57
So yeah, so so there is this kind of disconnect but they are looking for things.

54:01
So so a big company will be looking for some some way of efficiencies.

54:04
So whether that's reducing headcount, whether that's making things go faster and also they'll be looking for something they can talk about.

54:11
So if they can say right, we've got this new Ai tool that does makes our analysis quick, that gives us what what's the edge?

54:18
What's the competitive edge?

54:19
Well, like we used to have this thing this company called gem seek in Bulgaria and we're like, oh that's super cheap and they're the most advanced and they do all the virgins customer care or whatever.

54:29
You know, they'll be looking for for you to have some sort of, they want to borrow your name or borrow your your technology and say this is what we're using or maybe that's why they use dovetail.

54:39
I don't know.

54:39
But say, you know, this is because it's not only they want they want to imply that they're passing on the savings to the client, they won't be obviously, you know, they want to apply their passing on savings or that they are making them quicker picking up stuff that humans won't pick up, whatever, whatever it is.

55:00
So, so that's what they'll be looking for.

55:02
Okay, got it.

55:05
Okay.

55:05
And then I suppose the last thing I was kind of curious, I'm sorry, I'm slightly conscious of your time here.

55:10
I'm only waiting to be disturbed by my son's coming home from school.

55:13
So.

55:14
Okay.

55:16
What?

55:18
Okay.

55:20
So, I guess from the from, from the researchers point of view in abstraction of management and the budget and all of these things.

55:29
What what what do you think the what do you think, which problem do you think would make the kind of single biggest impact to, to be solved, I guess, within the within the process, like what what is the, you know, what's something that you really, you know, that that kind of frequently in, painfully disrupt your analysis and research that,, that you think it would be kind of meaningful for from a research perspective to solve.

56:05
So, I think that ultimately I think that researchers call researchers don't have enough time at all.

56:12
They don't have enough time because especially, I mean a lot of research is still online, but, you know, quite a lot of it's coming back to face to face and so you can spend all day going to lead to go and run to focus groups and then stay on and come back and that's your whole day got and that you can't really get into the analysis while you're on a train somewhere.

56:29
So I think it's disruption, I think qualitative life is very disruptive, it's quite disruptive, it's unsocial, it takes up a lot of time.

56:37
You're constantly, you would love to give, you know, a day to indulge yourself an analysis.

56:43
But there's even if you work for yourself, you genuinely cannot.

56:47
Well, I don't know, maybe some people can, but I can never, I'm too busy to really have a whole day.

56:53
So I often have to pay someone to make that problem go away.

56:57
I have to pay them to do the first round of analysis so that I can then, you know, do some understanding.

57:03
So yes, if someone could take away that headache of having to worry about where am I gonna find, it's that kind of, where am I going to find the time to really do this properly or at least do it to a level that I feel I can work start to work off that I'm not writing a debrief based on what I think I remember from a week ago, which is often what happens in reality, you know?

57:24
Yeah, it's like time time with time and the constraint of quality I suppose.

57:29
if you could, I suppose to then be confident that it was gonna be your best work as well.

57:33
Yeah, if you could just get you started, I think sometimes it's just a case of you kind of use, you kind of, as I said, when you do your whatever your field work and then you often say to the client the next day, you email the client, you say, look, here's some points that came out and you know, that they're going to be validated because generally your researchers instinct is, is right, but you have to evidence that you have to be able to do the analysis so that you can then put that into your debrief and that's the boring, but in a way that's the bit, that's a bit kind of, you know, clunky, it's like, I've got to get this done so that I can get to the good stuff so I can get to the writing, I can get to the inside development, I can do that, there's this bloody clunky stuff that has to happen, but you can't miss that stage out really, you know, you shouldn't miss that stage out, it does get missed out, but you shouldn't, so it's really about, for me, it's just like, it's always hanging over me that, you know, I've got to get started on, this is one of the like going to the gym I think you know I might be into the gym but I mean if you or exercise whatever it is it's like once I'm there be brilliant I just have to be rolled out.

58:35
Someone has to just get me started.

58:38
I have to someone has to make so I have to be rolled out the door or have to make some plans.

58:43
But there's a lot of qualitative researchers are under a lot of there's a lot of people push pulling them from different directions.

58:50
It's quite fragmented although it seems like a lovely you can really focus and do a focus group for two hours.

58:56
There's just lots of other bits going on all the time and and what an analysis does require big chunks of concentrated time that many qualities don't have.

59:06
So even if you could get if you think of analysis that there's not doing the analysis but this is the first, taking all the big amounts of information and just crunching it down that you can then look at and concentrate and you can pull out what you need from it hunky boring but it's a bit that I would never have done.

59:23
I would always get a research assistant or junior to do for me that first stage because I wouldn't have the time to do it justice and ballparks like how much would you have to pay a research assistant for a day of the time?

59:37
well I guess if you think about day rates as a research assistant.

59:40
Day rate is probably anything from 275 to some of them will charge 400.

59:46
And often if they if I'm thinking about what obviously what you charge a client to the day rate is very different to what you pay them.

59:51
But I mean Probably the minimum that you would get away with to the client or the research, the client, you would then charge you double that probably to a client.

1:00:02
So normally day rates for a director would be something like 2000 to a client and then it would kind of come down from their most call is not quoted on day rate anyway project basis.

1:00:13
But if you're a big company and you are costing up a project and as a big company you will have to cost people's time up based on their day rate and all day rate of a junior or a project manager or something.

1:00:26
It's probably three, you know, it's probably kind of 2 50 to 3 75.

1:00:31
400 something like that.

1:00:32
The internal day.

1:00:33
Right.

1:00:37
I just had one last question.

1:00:39
Sorry, I'm super quickly.

1:00:40
It's just slightly taking a step back.

1:00:43
It's I mean how how important our quotes are they, are they the primary evidence or is there any other evidence that you put out from from interviews that are particularly relevant for for a presentation or report.

1:00:58
So verbatim is definitely clients love verbatim because that's as a real story.

1:01:03
I think that there's still, you still need a human eye to look at the quality of those verbatim because it's not about numbers, it's about quality.

1:01:11
So there's hate decks.

1:01:13
I look at other people's dicks, there's a verbatim which says something like, yeah, I really like pizza.

1:01:19
Well good.

1:01:20
I'm glad, you know, but it's like, you know, like yesterday when I debrief this project tonight frank, they were like, there was one killer quote where someone talked about this is impressive enough to make me look at moving my portfolio.

1:01:31
So it's kind of verbatim are fine, but you need to have a beta males that are verbatim that are useful to, to and they're not just repeating the point that you already made the value.

1:01:44
And the other thing I would say about verbatim because they always need cleaning up.

1:01:48
there's lots of waffle in them or misspellings or whatever it is.

1:01:51
So if there's some tool that could just fix the spelling fix them, that would be good.

1:01:56
So yes, it verbatim is good.

1:01:57
Another thing that's really annoying about verbatim is having to annotate them.

1:02:01
So you have to put behind this is female 16 to whatever it is.

1:02:04
Guilford you know, buys pizzas, you know, those, those kind of things would be, I would love something where I could just every time I extracted a verbatim it automatically, there was some sort of tag that automatically attached to it.

1:02:19
So the items for sure is the primary one that people expect the other one is obviously video clips, edits that kind of stuff, any visual, any pictures that people have uploaded.

1:02:29
Although we don't, we try to kind of take their picture, their faces out of it.

1:02:34
and again they all come in different qualities, people have put them in different levels, whatever it is and then any kind of written work.

1:02:41
So we did I did one on indigestion where we asked people to draw what indigestion and heartburn feels like and they drew lots of Lakes of Fire and all that kind of stuff.

1:02:49
So they they're brilliant in those kind of things are really great to put in.

1:02:55
Yeah, certainly when we've had our done, when we did feedback and product reason or first thing that quotes a very sort of it's a real like argument argument killer I guess internally if someone disagrees with you and that sort of next slide is like 10 people saying that thing and it's very much kind of maybe that's why they kind of like the company's Yeah, I think I do think that's the thing.

1:03:17
I think that I just think you've got to be careful because obviously you can be very selective, you pick the debate.

1:03:23
So what I normally do is only put one or two on each page or where it's relevant and then I have an appendix with a whole like thematic.

1:03:30
So like these items about positives, negatives, these verbatim about how people do their washing up, whatever it is, so that's an appendix for them to go through and they can use themselves how they want to.

1:03:43
But yeah, I've seen a lot of reports that items are are kind of put in for just to fill the space or to say what's in the in the actual writing.

1:03:56
But they are very important.

1:03:58
I mean that's that's the kind of cool evidence if you like.

1:04:00
I suppose you know that you did some work and sometimes actually I put items in from that weren't in there but I'll put like quotes in.

1:04:11
So I did one about what healthy eating means.

1:04:16
And we had some great quotes from like it was about recipes, it was from Nigeria saying you know we're not all cooks but we're all eaters.

1:04:24
We know what we like to eat so those kind of things, they put those in.

1:04:28
Yeah, I see.

1:04:29
That's that's yeah.

1:04:31
Good context.

1:04:31
Really?

1:04:32
Okay nice.

1:04:34
Would you do if you have a minute I can just kind of show you roughly what the tool looks like just your feedback and obviously it's still work in progress and may change substantially.

1:04:44
This is kind of what we're up to at the moment if I go it's because when you when you when you shared last Time Windows live and had a complete meltdown.

1:04:58
so this is kind of what we've been thinking.

1:05:00
so far we've got a bit of a prototype for this.

1:05:02
So it's basically like a chat bots, like chat GPT, but crucially you upload your own information to it and then you can talk to it and any generations that it produces or questions that responses have references in them like this.

1:05:16
So if you click on those, it will show you where in the in the document or the, you know, all the all the sort of piece of evidence where that comes from, essentially.

1:05:25
So you can kind of reference it back and make sure that it's it's not making things up.

1:05:30
And so yeah, that that's kind of we've been exploring really in you know, we've yeah, essentially been trying to kind of determine whether like that that's the sort of right approach and you know what people a little bit and kind of collect feedback as we go to see if that would be helpful working from a transcript that someone's put it in there and then you can ask it to search the transcript to answer those questions.

1:05:54
Yeah, several transcripts, I think I think I would like to be able to do with that, then is to then have a separate like scratch pad or working to cheat whatever it is where then I put those into themes or like because you couldn't ask and I don't think one of the key themes because you've got specifically challenge or what I mean, that's always going through the objectives if you like, sort of you can take the objectives and say have I?

1:06:17
Because one of the things always is to check that you've met the objectives of the of the project.

1:06:21
So if you could put your objectives in, it could pull up stuff that match those objectives that that would be, that would be good.

1:06:28
Or you could put your discussion guided or whatever it is.

1:06:30
But if you could put something in the check that you had done your objectives, that would be good.

1:06:34
But then you want to then take that and put it into things.

1:06:37
And the other thing I think that's Important in coal is sometimes about the individuals.

1:06:42
So how would I say?

1:06:44
So for example, the client is just a really big project, which was a community with 40 people about who are approaching retirement, all about emotionally, how do they feel about retirement?

1:06:54
And the clients come back today and said they want to speak to two or three of them who were thinking that they couldn't retire because of cost of living.

1:07:00
And it's not a question that we asked people, but now I'm gonna have to go through the entire thing and try and remember who said that.

1:07:06
So this would be good for me to be able to say like which participants mentioned cost of living for which, you know, which people said retire early didn't can't retire really whatever it is, so it'll save me, you know, all this stuff is there.

1:07:21
It would save me a huge job which I'm gonna have to do now to get my head back into the project from two months ago to identify three participants.

1:07:29
Okay.

1:07:30
To what extent?

1:07:32
Because one thing we think that the chatbot approaches certainly captures people's imagination.

1:07:37
I think especially DPT, I think everyone's everyone's had their mind blown a little bit about what you do.

1:07:43
I do wonder though, to what extent it's the actually the right solution.

1:07:47
If the problem I suppose people are solving is like finding and sorting things and whether just like a good search tool would be actually equally as good or whether the synthesis around that, whether people would I guess like a trusted and be find it useful even if I don't know.

1:08:05
Yeah, well I guess you're not it's not like so the problem with GPT is that you can't really trust it because you can ask the same question that give you three different answers to the same question and you can't really trust it for its facts, but this is information that you've put in and it's kind of factual as it's sort of factual in the sense that people have said those things or what it's there.

1:08:24
And I think that people are seeing chat GPT and things like that as a kind of search in a way it does feel like a little bit like a it's not just it's not like we're so if you imagine if you use the search analogy, google you ask a question like I don't know how much leg room people want, whatever, like what's comfortable to use your dovetail example and it will give you a whole lot of then you've got to go and research it, you've got to click through all that kind of stuff.

1:08:48
Whereas chat GPT, I could just say like what's the best leg room on the flight and it will do all of that stuff, it'll give me an answer.

1:08:55
I won't have to read 27 Forbes articles or economist articles or british Airways information, so it's cutting through the crap and the clutter really bring you what you want.

1:09:06
And I think so it is a kind of, it is a form of search search and organized or search.

1:09:11
And I think, I think, I suppose the difference with it is that it's it kind of tries to amalgamate the responses into into an answer for you really.

1:09:21
I mean like because we actually, you know students, so we have a we actually tried this out with a bunch of these are some user interviews of sanitizing names and stuff, but because we have like a search in here like you know, what is the biggest problem for Jeannie.

1:09:41
you know, you can get it to you know, you can get it to kind of extract quotes, Let's do that again, okay, like that and it will try and highlight the right right part.

1:09:59
I mean I think would be, I mean even that kind of stuff, so like, so what I tend to use that, so I just, this project, I just said goodnight Frank, we did 10 interviews with High net worth and the transcript ran to something like 70 pages, so if I want to find, I remember someone said something about house in the Cotswolds, I've got to use control left and I've got to then find Cotswolds, then I've got to go through the results and you know, if I can just put in like who's got a house in cottage in the Cotswolds or who's got a dairy farm in the Cotswolds, you get answers rather than search results.

1:10:33
So I'm having to then search and then we'll bring up 27 mentions of Cotswolds or dairy farms and I've got to go through results and pick it all up and then I've got a copy and paste it or whatever it is I'm doing with it, so, so yeah, there's a lot of kind of leg work that could be taken out that doesn't remove from the sense that you're doing analysis, that's what I'm saying, that's why things like this, this definite stages of analysis.

1:10:55
The first is very much data collection, data sorting thematic and that kind of stuff and then it's actually using that to answer your questions.

1:11:05
Do you do you imagine that?

1:11:06
Do you think people imagine using things like chat?

1:11:08
Gpt for analysis or for more for like a search stage in order to I guess like remove remove some of these like simple issues that you've you've mentioned Or is the is the is the excitement around actually being able to kind of like asking for, It's like your opinion on something or is it more to kind of narrow down to basically control f better through a document?

1:11:34
Yeah, I don't know.

1:11:35
I mean, so in this discussion that we had yesterday the discussion, there were some different schools of thought, there's a little bit of nervousness about because apparently you can do panel, it can it can have like panels of avatars or something and you can ask opinion that's not real consumer.

1:11:51
It's a little bit of anxiety around that.

1:11:54
And then there's people sort of saw it as more like contributing to almost upfront brainstorming, coming with ideas, making better proposals, writing better pitch documents after you finish your debrief checking against is there any you know, like so like I was saying about using psychological anthropology theories, You could then go to it and say what's the psychological theory of being social or being social beings and it could just fill you in a little bit there less so about working with your material and doing analysis.

1:12:22
Although someone did say about they had put some transcripts into it and they had asked to pull out the top five key themes.

1:12:29
But I don't think anyone trusted enough to know that those are five key themes at this point ownership.

1:12:36
It's human and I think, yeah, and that's why they were talking very much about this augmented human ai relationship rather than an alternate or replacement people.

1:12:47
I thought people would be a bit more.

1:12:48
I mean there were 57 60 of us on the call.

1:12:51
The call yesterday we went in to break up rooms and discussed it.

1:12:55
I expected a bit more pushback and a bit more fear and it wasn't, there's an openness, as long as it's as long as the human is the control on it, you know, human human is working it rather than being worked by it.

1:13:11
So it's sort of kind of like a helpful tool rather than a takeover tool I think.

1:13:20
But the thing about quality that just produces that produces such a huge amount.

1:13:24
Like even just 10 interviews you've got suddenly like 70 to 100 pages of word document to go through to then sort and organize is a real pain.

1:13:36
I'd like it to pull I'd like be able to say pull out everything to do with the first time you ever drank coffee.

1:13:43
I'd love it to do that and then I don't have to sit and do it so or you know, but I have to think of the questions, that's the thing.

1:13:50
So your brain, your human is still involved in kind of directing it and thinking of the questions, but there's a little sprite that's running around inside the machine.

1:14:03
Got it okay, Rebecca I don't think more of your time.

1:14:07
This has been really, really insightful, really appreciate it.

1:14:10
And thanks for walking through your process and providing these examples to say I can put you in touch with the bigger agency but they're more quant based but I think you're, well I can tell you from from the back room of it, it's all going to be cost and headcount driven and efficiency driven and also what what can we spin on this to look like we've got something new, some new fancy tool that we can play with and we can sell to our clients with your plans anyway.

1:14:48
Was that?

1:14:49
Yeah, I I think, I think it's I think it's certainly very like, I think it's I think it's really, really kind of you and I think you're probably quite uniquely placed and it sounds like this type of thing really frustrated you and you you kind of just went out and started your own thing and clearly doing doing doing very well as a result.

1:15:06
I mean I think that's it's probably, I imagine, I think probably quite, quite lucky to have managed to chat to you in the end, I think because it's probably, yeah, it's really awesome.

1:15:21
Look, I mean, keep, keep in touch, let me know how you're going in your development.

1:15:24
I will actually have lunch tomorrow with a big agency, so I might just have a few little casual chats with them about some of the irritation because actually, I tell you something, so they have struggled with the amount of work they've had, so they've hired loads and loads of people and have time to train them properly.

1:15:43
So they now have a problem with turnover, with staff turnover.

1:15:46
They have a problem with kind of half finished work.

1:15:48
That's not very good that seniors are having to finish off.

1:15:50
So there's a whole quality issue that comes into it as well.

1:15:53
So, this is something which helps to, to deliver a standard or deliver a certain level of quality that kind of allows then their researchers to work from because they don't have time to train them.

1:16:05
They're under pressure to hire anyone who walks in the door, practically.

1:16:08
Not with, not quite that bad, but I mean, there is a certain pressure to, to fulfill, they wanna be in the same.

1:16:15
You'll find ad agencies in their strategic departments, they will hire, they will win a big account and they win Tiktok Tiktok and they've gotta just bring a team in to work on that and they don't have time to train them.

1:16:26
They're not working in the office all the time.

1:16:28
So they're not observing.

1:16:29
So there's these gaps that people are falling through.

1:16:31
So I know that that's a concern for big agencies as they may be dramatically increase their headcount and are not able to train them.

1:16:39
They're not able to give them tools and not able to kind of bring them up to speed and to provide the quality their clients expect.

1:16:45
And that's particularly dangerous.

1:16:46
And it's such a, it's a classic and consult, isn't it?

1:16:50
Sort of the big problems.

1:16:52
It's just it's like, it's like margin and headcount.

1:16:55
I think the releasing people.

1:16:57
Okay, well, I mean, look, I mean, if you could send you over a blood perhaps, and if you if you feel like mentioning if there's someone, one of the larger agencies you think might be interesting for us to chat to speak to them and then see how I work with a big finance research consultancy as well.

1:17:15
And they just hired two people just hired two juniors just to start running their communities because they run communities for all the big finance, because I used to do quite a lot for that, but I don't have time to do that anymore.

1:17:27
So they hired these two new people, but they are still not quite up to speed.

1:17:33
I mean, that sounds great, like yeah, let me let me send you a follow up with a bit of a blurb and more description how we're going to proceed and if you if there's someone you think would be interesting for us to chat to you, then I would love an intro.

1:17:43
Yeah, exactly.

1:17:44
And then just keeping up to date, tell me how you're doing with your planning.

1:17:49
but yeah, so you're gonna come up against if you can demonstrate cost savings and something fancy that they can promote and say it's theirs, they can white label it whatever they want to do and say it's just like brand new fancy tool that makes cole faultless fact check, then they'll probably go for it.

1:18:16
Honestly, it'll be it'll be head of the head of the research department who doesn't do any hands on research anymore.

1:18:23
Procurement, you probably think, yeah, that sounds good.

1:18:26

1:18:29
You gotta sell it above their heads.

1:18:30
All right.

1:18:31
