# Sheryl Sandberg Ted Talk

Sheryl Sandberg: So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky we don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights. And amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. (00;00;16;10 - 00;00;37;21)

Sheryl Sandberg: But all that aside, we still have a problem and it's a real problem. And the problem is this Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 190 heads of state nine are women. Of all the people in parliaments in the world, 13% are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top sea level jobs board seats tops out at 15 16%. (00;00;38;21 - 00;01;08;25)

Sheryl Sandberg: The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the nonprofit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women. Women at the top 20%. We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that of senior managers of married senior managers, two thirds of the married men had children, and only one third of the married women had children. (00;01;09;08 - 00;01;40;27)

Sheryl Sandberg: A couple of years ago, I was in New York and I was pitching a deal and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices. You can picture. And I'm in the meeting. It's about a three hour meeting and 2 hours in. There's kind of needs to be that fire break and everyone stands up and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. (00;01;42;06 - 00;02;00;28)

Sheryl Sandberg: And I realize he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. And so I said, So did you just move into this office? And he said, No, we've been here about a year. And I said, Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year? (00;02;01;18 - 00;02;23;21)

Sheryl Sandberg: And he looked at me and he said, Yeah, or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom. So the question is, how are we going to fix this? How do we change these numbers at the top? How do we make this different? I want to start out by saying I talk about this about keeping women in the workforce, because I really think that's the answer. (00;02;24;13 - 00;02;50;16)

Sheryl Sandberg: In the high income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top, Fortune 500 CEO jobs are the equivalent in other industries. The problem that I am convinced is that women are dropping out. Now. People talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs. Companies should have to train women. (00;02;50;29 - 00;03;11;18)

Sheryl Sandberg: I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important. Today, I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves? What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us? What are the messages we tell our daughters? Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. (00;03;11;25 - 00;03;31;04)

Sheryl Sandberg: I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco where I live on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter, who's three when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging the leg, crying, Mom, you don't get on the plane saying, this is hard. (00;03;31;14 - 00;03;48;21)

Sheryl Sandberg: I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce that don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. My talk today is about what the messages are. If you do want to stay in the workforce. And I think there are three. (00;03;49;07 - 00;04;08;23)

Sheryl Sandberg: One sit at the table to make your partner a real partner. And three, look at that. Don't leave before you leave. Number one, sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. (00;04;08;26 - 00;04;32;27)

Sheryl Sandberg: And then he had these two women who are traveling with him who are pretty senior in his department. And I kind of said to them, sit at the table, come sit at the table. And they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college my senior year, I took a course called European Intellect Oral History. (00;04;32;27 - 00;04;48;08)

Sheryl Sandberg: Don't you love that kind of thing from college? I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student, and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar. And my brother, smart guy, but a water polo playing pre-med who was a sophomore. The three of us take this class together and then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin. (00;04;48;09 - 00;05;10;26)

Sheryl Sandberg: Goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother's kind of busy. He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple of days before the exam to get himself tutor. The three of us go to the exam together and we sit down and we study, you know, sit there for 3 hours in our little blue notebooks. (00;05;10;27 - 00;05;33;26)

Sheryl Sandberg: Yes, I'm that old. And we walk out. We look at each other, and we say, How'd you do? And Carrie says, Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic. And I say, God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property, the philosophers that follow. And my brother says, I got the top grade in the class. (00;05;33;26 - 00;05;55;13)

Sheryl Sandberg: You got the top grade in the class? You don't know anything. The problem with these stories is that these show what the data shows. Women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low. (00;05;55;13 - 00;06;17;19)

Sheryl Sandberg: Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57% of boys entering or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary and only 7% of women and most importantly, men, attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. (00;06;18;11 - 00;06;42;27)

Sheryl Sandberg: If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, I'm awesome. If you ask me, obviously, why are you even asking? If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them. They got lucky. They worked really hard. Why does this matter? Boy, it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table. (00;06;43;10 - 00;07;06;19)

Sheryl Sandberg: And no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success or they don't even understand their own success. I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work for. All these fabulous women, believe in yourself, negotiate for yourself on your own success. I wish I could tell that to my daughter. (00;07;07;01 - 00;07;26;13)

Sheryl Sandberg: But it's not that simple, because what the data shows above all else is one thing, which is that success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding because we all know this to be true. There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Voisin, and she's an operator in a venture capital company in Silicon Valley. (00;07;27;12 - 00;07;54;15)

Sheryl Sandberg: And she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In 2000, two, not so long ago, a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it Heidi Voisin. And he gave that case out, both of them, to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word, Heidi, to Howard, but that one word made a really big difference. (00;07;54;21 - 00;08;17;07)

Sheryl Sandberg: He then surveyed the students and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought, Heidi and Howard were equally competent. And that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him, You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi, not so sure. She's a little out for herself. (00;08;17;29 - 00;08;36;02)

Sheryl Sandberg: She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughter and our colleagues. We have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table. And we have to do it in a world where for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers there will not. (00;08;36;02 - 00;08;57;18)

Sheryl Sandberg: The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this, and I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple of hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting kind of outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. (00;08;59;04 - 00;09;19;14)

Sheryl Sandberg: And I said, okay. And she sat down and we talked and she said, I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up. I said, What do you mean? She said, Well, you're giving this talk. And then you said, you're going to take two more questions. And I had my hand up with lots of other people. (00;09;19;28 - 00;09;33;08)

Sheryl Sandberg: And then you took two more questions. And I put my hand down and I noticed all the women put their hand down. And then you took more questions only from the men. And I thought to myself, Wow, if it's me who cares about this, obviously giving this talk during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised and the women's hands are still raised. (00;09;33;08 - 00;09;55;25)

Sheryl Sandberg: How good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women? We've got to get women to sit at the table. The numbers message number to make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. (00;09;56;11 - 00;10;18;22)

Sheryl Sandberg: The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework. The man does and the woman does three times the amount of child care the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more? (00;10;19;09 - 00;10;41;11)

Sheryl Sandberg: The causes of this are really complicated and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football watching in general, laziness is the cause. I think the cause is more complicated. I think as a society we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives and careers, and it's hard. (00;10;42;04 - 00;11;03;13)

Sheryl Sandberg: When I go to the mommy and me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders. If we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. (00;11;04;02 - 00;11;24;26)

Sheryl Sandberg: Studies show that households with equal earning an equal responsible party also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more. How shall I say this on this stage? They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. Message number three. Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking and I see this all the time with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. (00;11;26;09 - 00;11;59;20)

Sheryl Sandberg: Here's what happens. We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy and she starts thinking about having a child. And from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing? And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore. (00;12;00;04 - 00;12;20;04)

Sheryl Sandberg: She doesn't look for a promotion. She doesn't take on the new project. She doesn't say Me, I want to do that. She starts leaning back. The problem is that let's say she got pregnant that day. That day, nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath. Fast forward two years more often. And as I've seen it, women start thinking about this way earlier when they get engaged, when they get married, when they start thinking about trying to have a child, which can take a long time. (00;12;20;14 - 00;12;48;18)

Sheryl Sandberg: One woman came to see me about this and I kind of looked at her. She looked a little young and I said, So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby? And she said, Oh, no, I'm not married. She didn't even have a boyfriend. I said, You're thinking about this just way too early. But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back. (00;12;49;04 - 00;13;10;17)

Sheryl Sandberg: Everyone who's been through this and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. (00;13;10;26 - 00;13;39;19)

Sheryl Sandberg: Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to leave to take to take a break for a child and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. My generation, really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top. (00;13;40;15 - 00;14;03;20)

Sheryl Sandberg: They're just not moving. We are not going to get to 50% of the population. In my generation. There will not be 50% of people at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world that was run were half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women would be a better world. (00;14;03;29 - 00;14;24;21)

Sheryl Sandberg: And it's not just because people would know where the women's bathroom are. Even though that would be very helpful, I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five year old son and a two year old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home. (00;14;24;21 - 00;14;41;29)

Sheryl Sandberg: And I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments. Thank you. (00;14;42;21 - 00;15;15;28)
