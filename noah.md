Some how is the game really good really good fun.

Just one of these like sessions we turn up and play so it's like

it's not like did you win did you lose? It's like just Vibes. That's cool Good Vibes Good Vibes.

Nice, no.

How can I help Jack hit me with you. Let me was yeah, you pick it your brains. Um, basically

basically

I'm interested to I'm trying to understand more about

like qualitative research. So so, you know research depending on like I guess like narrative interviewing or whatever. Um

And pain points. They're in I think the the two the two areas. I feel like you've you've got a ton of experience with I'd love to hear about like one in Consulting and and then two maybe in VC if it's a thing that I don't know so

um

What was the like?

Okay, so I guess like super high level like in in consultancy. Like I don't know a ton about it. Um, what is the

Who are the people that do a lot of the like qualitative interviewing, you know, like talking to customers and key stakeholders and all of that like what kind of what kind of job title do they have?

mostly business analyst okay

and the associates put the analysts mostly and are there people who do specifically more like quantitative stuff or just like, okay.

Yeah, so so it begins at least.

Which is sort of what I know.

regular project all of the actual work will be done by the analy listening since

okay, some some managers what we're doing some of it like

they'll be doing the interviewing.

If there are Excel models to be made around that they'll also be making Excel models.

There are some people.

Who's a whole job is like.

more researchy

Right. So like McKinsey owns a company called like fanata, for example.

And who do research there's a company called rbr who do something that's similar to this as well.

Why they're like producing data sets and general research. So.

the sort of Job Done by gen normal generalist management Consultants like

people I was

people like people

Like people who do the job I did. Yeah wellera.

That's gonna be hard to automate in an effective manner.

Because you're talking to like it's kind of small numbers of people in quite an ad hoc and like all over the place Manor.

That doesn't lend itself naturally to like.

rigorous and systematized

processes

What do you do you have like a good example of like a project?

that you kind of worked on the like if you were kind of

You trying to if you're trying to describe like your your job at McKenzie, like do you have an example of like a project that you worked on like start to finish the kind of?

so the most like

so I'll give you two examples.

This is what a typical normal Consulting project a little bit like

Right, but I was working in the government.

Department all men are brief of our team was like help the government forecast how much PPE

We need that was the question.

and so we

like well, we'll build an Excel model that forecasts it.

And we'll basically just ask everyone in the government for what the inputs are.

So we got like

saying to give us the forecast numbers of like covid.

And we were like interviewing a fuck ton of doctors and nurses and stuff to figure out like okay if there were like X many covid patients.

You would need to have why number of gloves per patient because you'd be doing this.

And it requires six nurses and 10% of covid patients would need to be ventilated and if they're ventilated they need you know, whatever whatever you yeah, they're doing a load of interviews there.

but that's so ad-hoc and random because you're just trying to figure out like really specific small questions that

it sounds like it sounds like you could have basically emailed them and that would have been just as good.

In theory. Yes in practice. No, okay, because often you don't know the right questions to ask, right.

Especially when you're like because you're consultant, right? You don't even know like

you never done medical shit and ever.

right, and so

you do actually need to talk to these people. A lot of the meetings do end up quite like email me.

Yeah, but yeah, well, I think it's more so

that's a normal Consulting project.

Where you're like, essentially?

Structuring War structure your sort of you're working with the client, but the client already has all the information in its Institution.

The most part and you're talking to all the people within the institution and collecting and systematizing that so that it can be like easily presented management.

But you're kind of being paid to like Talent institution what it already knows.

interesting

Um the flip side that's more Peaceable.

Is due diligence is okay?

so private Equity Firm will come to McKinsey and be like

For the example. I have it's fucking random companies. It's like

We have a company that.

What is it it like?

If if I have a wine.

That eco-friendly they hire this third party company to like certified certification, right? So yes, it's a good friendly.

It's not just me saying my ones eco-friendly someone else is saying my ones you.

Okay, well overloads of shit. So there's a load of like good production standards called the ISO standards. Oh, yeah. Yeah like this you type box why it and all that? Yeah.

Yeah, and so a lot of a lot of regulators require you have proven that you met those standards.

Okay, and so this certification agency will come in and audit you.

And confirm. Yes, you've met those that so we were doing a due diligence on a certification company.

and what that looks like is

You know.

Again, there's a lot of really classic questions. Like what's the market growth?

And so then you do a load of interviews with like people around and like what's the market growth?

Yeah, and then that sort of thing and then you split it down which markets going faster, right? Why is it going?

so like

you could you in a sense are gonna do at the same thing fundamentally for most DD's dude. Do you is it still a case that you don't really know what questions you can ask until you get that's not like a fact-finding mission. It's kind of exploratory as well those cases, you know more like what you're gonna ask, okay.

and indeed

one of the things we did not project or another one another one of the judgments that I did. They also blow together anyway.

The we did a survey.

Of like a thousand people. Hmm. Why only expensive

Where you just like have a list of questions is like a lot of people to answer.

What is the most so that's like medium repeatable?

me maximum

Is like true reasons?

Like rbr I told you about.

orthonalta

we're like, so the best is rbr I worked with them loads with Visa a hobby or

is this owned by Mackenzie as well?

No.

This has been bought by like random people. What is it? I'm trying to find out. What does it stand for? I'll be your

I said all your consulting or

hmm. I'll be your London.

Oh, yeah, this looks like oh, yeah, London. Okay good.

These some are they one of these like kol companies.

Well, are they do they like?

Because I've I think one of these companies where they you know, they'll you say like, oh, I need to talk to Sony's an expert and like the the automotive manufacturer industry and they're like, okay, here's the like head of Ops from like, I don't know. So those are those are like those are like such like in few people. Right? Right, he's got so and we did work with those guys for McKinsey. These guys have one thing they're good at was like payment.

So they were produced reports every year on like payment industry.

Okay, and we as Visa commissioned them.

We gave them all our data.

On like card date card data and we commissioned them to like go estimate. What visas market share was, right?

And then like forecast how it was growing.

and so they have a lot of people who like

You know, but most of that on the ground workers and not experts in payments.

and linguists

interesting, so we speak loads of languages because they have to go through the like

the Central Bank documents

Okay.

And like fucking every country in the year.

Got it.

So but they produce the same sort of shit every year because they update their numbers.

Like forecasting the payments industry so because they're doing the same thing every year but like one year ahead like one year forward like it feels like it's more standardized work.

Where I'm sure there's a ton of inefficiency.

I suppose like what I'm curious anymore about really is like um

It's like narrative interviewing stuff. So the example I came across from the Amber told me about was like

she did a project that Nordic spirit is news companies. Yeah, and they were like

You know.

We want to we want to get we want to increase our market share in the I think is the UK or something. I don't know and so they

they went to like one of these search firms and then the search firms pulled together all of these like different individuals. They're like here are some women between 18 and 25 who like who smoked Jewels here are some like

Grizzly old blokes he like Rollies or whatever and like here's some other people who like, I don't know fucking disposable like chewing tobacco or something. I don't know whatever and then they like

Talk to all of them. They were like, you know these women they were like, why do you like? Why do you like these Vapes or something and one was like, oh because like I don't like the smell of like cigarettes. It's like unfeminine. And so like the jewel is like a way to get around that and like they like made these like personas and kind of try to understand the like reasoning behind it. And then they like you start to create a strategy for like

Forum, you know for not experience and in the end they were like go after these like go after these women they're like, I don't know they like, you know, you they they're like the smell of nicotine and you know, they can do it on a night out with anyone noticing um this sort of stuff and so like

That that is like a research process and it sounded kind of interesting like a lot of like unstructured interviewing.

Um synthesis of data like that. Who how do I find like, who do I need to find who does like I guess like that kind of work. Like what is that like as a is that just strategy Consulting is like a very specific example, or

I did something like this at one point, okay?

like a bank

is a strategy Consulting I guess.

So design people, you know, yeah.

hmm

don't know.

I don't know.

It's a good question.

I think that I do in in as an abstraction like I mean tell me about the thing you did with the bank. Like what was that was that about?

so

that was about like

we were

we we were like designing their.

Like next let Next Generation.

a king

investment proposition I think

They wanted to like they are like there is he realized they had a lot of old people customers.

Who left like a bazillion pounds in like a current account? Yeah.

And they were like we can convince these old people to invest their money.

And there's like fuck tons of money just sitting around and all like accounts and we can shift it.

Okay.

Was like, how do you like?

don't

like a design lead

Who let us on into doing interviews of like random people?

Why don't you?

And they're right. I don't like to invest because I like to see my money. Do I buy properties?

My daughter hotel room, which is my investment with a guaranteed return. Anyway, oh my God.

Okay, I mean this sounds okay. This is interesting. How many of these people did you speak to like how okay for so like, how long is this project?

I went on for like 12 weeks and like how many of these people do you speak to?

Okay, honey, 10:20 and like

was that like the meat of the like data collection was like most of the research was like these people and plus some like inside from the

What are the surveys while I'm not sure?

but like

the quantitative thing it was very like human it was the quality thing was like superhuman.

It was very like oh.

all let's understand your life and your persona and we like we're like crafted like a this is drill, you know, she doesn't like to invest because

he likes me too much.

You know, I mean, right.

Right. Yeah got it. And like how do you

how did you how do you analyze all that data afterwards? Like do you record this stuff or like do you just take notes? And so we filmed the people and I took notes.

Okay.

I don't know.

sort of a messy process

how much messy how like

It's like radically aggressively unscientific.

Like your end is like dramatically small and Cherry picks. Yeah.

and

it's so loosely done whoever is running the process.

basically talks to a lot of people as like

The best time described it it's not really so.

That like design LED, you know.

the frankly was closer to

creative writing with a few muses

it was

Truly positive research, okay.

With any like significant intrinsic value from the world, so it felt more like you just taking these people to like inspire you to like.

Be right about like what problems people have?

Because you weren't like we weren't really looking at.

like actual

we didn't have the we didn't have this like frankly the

the n

to be able to say anything like truly useful.

Yeah, I guess that's what probably followed up the service or something right like a no.

exactly

What do you how like how was that process like was that was that was that fun? Like I don't going through all of that like

it was quite fun to be honest. Yeah.

The round nose as you it was fun. It was interesting.

It was Big Time sync, okay.

All right, like like frankly.

It takes a lot of time.

What do you think? Yes. Sorry, Carol.

Now did the top thing is?

Though do it.

so that when you don't know the questions to ask

you don't know you're gonna

Head do it with like really?

Really open-ended like what do you like like, you're asking me now, right?

you're like

explore explore the problems made when you don't really know it and then you hear a load of things.

And you take those things. There's my you know, I've got six problems and you talk to all other people, you know, okay. Well, you know, I talked to ten people now regularly. There are three big things that keep coming up why people aren't investing.

Or whatever.

and then you can follow that with a

Survey, do you is it pretty is it pretty obvious after a time? Like do you need to like

You know, do you need to like have some sort of Eureka moment one morning in the shower to like figure out why or is it just kind of like, okay, they're all just saying the same shed after a while.

When I did it.

A lot of the stuff was quite clear.

Okay. So a lot of the stuff was quite clear like you had people being like

You know, it's we have one guys in the state agent like, you know you invest and he was like, no, I don't really invest because I don't have that much money and I need my money ready to be available for me.

Right great. One of the reasons he doesn't invest is cash flow and concern that it's illiquid.

I have one thing now that I can't if you made loads of money, what would you do with it? Like would you invest it was like no, I'd buy property why he was like because you know, I don't really trust like financing instruments. I don't know like wrong at least no property is there and it's like a physical thing and you're like, okay great. Yeah understand that you can't understand investment.

And he was like, oh, yeah and also like property like, you know always does well.

Slight. Okay. Yeah perceived risk, right like yeah, and so like, you know people

It you know in that case at least there were some pretty clear things. That would just come.

You know, yeah.

Do you have to go back and like ask people a question again? Because you found out something interesting later on.

Not in this case.

And another case. Yes, so in my due diligence.

We don't the one guy who just so good in the industry.

He does so many answers.

We came up with more questions and we just brought him back in.

We just pumped him for numbers and like a grand well like hot now at work and Legend.

We paid that guy likes to be K. I just taught him like hours and hours.

but and like like I was the he was like

but that's different right because he was like

X so the company were looking to buy he was like X head of that like Middle East Division. Okay. All right. She's a bit of a like

and say he had like like and we were not allowed to talk to anyone who's left Within.

enough

and he had left like

like 530 days before hunting.

Right like the output minimum and I was like, obviously I didn't tell him we were looking by.

So, you know don't.

Speculate don't talk about the mark as a whole just think about what you know, think about what you're like some sort of like prime prime, you know, some sort of it sounds like some sort of Castle Market of people and he's like a kind of prime, you know a prime stock of you know, yeah. He was Prime up with dog.

That's it. I wonder I want to be pulled in Bowling in research funds.

Just the best money you can imagine what what are you?

He said it was like time-consuming. Like what is the offset of that? Like does anyone care like you just slapping this on the client like known you know or is this like is this like does that like ruin your week or something or like I mean, so

We don't have that cost.

In terms of like having to pay the search for people.

That's fine.

We do care about time as consultants. Okay, because like we have a fixed amount of time.

to deliver shit in

so if we waste our time.

Like sure fundamentally trans paying for it, but the client gets less.

That they have paid for right right. So McKinsey at the same amount for the project whatever happens.

Um, so like it's okay if you pay, you know, a load to like external.

People coming for research that cost gets passed through.

and the client probably doesn't mind because they are like I've interviewed 1,000 people and obviously have

and everyone's like yeah, that makes sense.

but

so cost isn't really a big sensitivity but a big sensitivity is time because as a consultant if you've wasted like a week doing load of interviews that haven't given you anything useful.

That's a week of work that you haven't delivered. Hmm.

Is that how does it flip side is?

that makes it a get like a little bit less bad is the fact that

everyone understands

this stuff takes time.

And so the client if you you know, one of the big most powerful things we came in and we said look we have had done this many interviews talk to this many people. We've heard this many things like real people.

and so the client already from that that is work that they can kind of be like, yes, they

've done. It's like a thousand quotes from my retards.

and if the quote the badger bit like whatever but I have at least

how do you how do you get all those quotes out you have to go through and like tag all of this shit or

yeah, the business are less.

Oh, really?

You just and you I'm like typing down the whole time and sometimes you hear stuff and you're like, yes, this is

Money, you know recorded all the conversations but there was you know, you mostly don't go back over the recordings. You mostly just like no account and doing it like doing the typing live.

Making a load of notes and then afterwards like buying the ones that are valuable.

But what would what wasn't what was shit though? Is the transcription software. That sucks use otter.

No, no, we just use like I don't know whatever so both actually both cases. I

don't know what I don't know what the transcription software.

The other guy I used.

But it wasn't very good. And then when we with these search firms you go through I remember who

But you know you bring them up your I want to talk to like some Executives or whatever.

And they provide like complimentary.

transcription

through the AI which is garbage.

Interesting and then you can pay extra to have someone actually transcribe it. Is that why you guys don't use it because it's just bad or like

is it just too too time consuming?

Um

I guess if it was if it worked well it I mean

It so in an ideal. It depends if like in an Ideal World you get the notes that you need down first time.

Because you've already like otherwise you'd like, you know, that's much quicker than having to go back through your light into you.

Like pick through your script that you've taught.

But yeah, I mean it would you would use it more if the transcription soft.

Ware and do people

do people so I'm in this position for so like for instance we did so I didn't I did a bunch like user feedback.

with

like a bunch of values

did what I say was gonna Chef you up.

Sorry, yeah. Yeah, I think I showed you that.

We feel that stuff are not banter channel. It's so funny. Oh.

Amazing. This was this is this was like the people that I actually don't want to Chef us up the the tool. Um one guy said he was gonna jump off a bridge before he found us, which is nice.

You like but we're gonna put it on our website like Genie preventing suicide since 2022.

But yeah.

Okay, so I'd end up with these like quotes right here.

like these different people

um, and then like I kind of show this the rest of the team, um, and then

they asked me like left field questions about this stuff.

Um, I don't really knows it's on will be like how many of them are like OCR in documents because they look at it and they've had some idea they'll be like, oh the the quality of the quality of the summer is not good enough and it's like well like all my head is a fucked up and they're like how many these people are ocring them and like I don't know, um, it might have come up. I'm really sure and I have to go back and look like is it common for you to find like, I don't know you end up in this position where like

I don't know. I guess you like.

you need to go and

I guess like like you have a thought you need to go and look back again. Like try maybe like

maybe validate the idea or something or maybe somebody else looking at it has like a different idea to you and you've got to like

that's not that territory. Oh, yeah all the time. Why is it like that territory?

Okay. Imagine you're doing it you diligence, right?

And you spent the first you've got three weeks you spent the first two weeks doing interviews.

You turn out your initial conclusions.

To the whatever your client.

at the end of the second week and they're like, oh this is

Really interesting, but what about like like how many of these people?

Have a second job in construction.

because that's really important and like we actually only care about what people have second loving construction thing and you're like

I didn't ask. I just done 20 interviews life.

And I have oh, hey, you know so like that is really challenging.

why it's really important in these things like

Try an online on like you have to take so when I was doing my due diligence interviews, you you line on you line up like a set Quest set of questions like a fixed set of questions. You need to answer.

Before you can just do the other shit.

Yeah.

And then you're like you like take your way down those boxes, okay?

So they're like the must that they're like the vertebrae questions and then you can explore around that but you got ask those.

Yeah, okay, um and those vertebrate questions. Well, I mean, they include things like, you know, oh what like

depends on things like

like

You know, what will the market growth rate be like and then you just stop them as soon as they start talking you stop. I don't give a shit. Give me a number.

What's the market rate going to be like in the next five years?

Okay, see yeah, you language like Babel like stop talking to me. Tell me the number.

so you have a bit of that and then you like those are things that

Use of for example like so in this case, you know us here. Yes or no. Yeah.

And then like that will allow that would allow you to cut this data.

My various things so I don't know I see right. It's

You know when you have like a image of a PDF and you want to be able to select the text?

I love that. Yeah, it's object character recognition. So you just you put it through and then it puts a text layer. And so if it was in it was a photo you can like selected them.

Yeah, apple photos has that now. Yeah, it's mad. Um, yeah, it's it's yeah, there's a whole there's a bunch of research around. It's really interesting if you're a nerd but Google versus doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah, so

I guess.

I guess having like some level of like.

I mean, that's a highly specific one.

Which you just add in now going forward I wouldn't.

I wouldn't try a backsold. That's anyone like all the going back to them.

Unless unless you could follow unless you and have a load of these questions, right?

And you followed them up with a survey.

Thank you so much for talking to us last week.

Really appreciate you time.

Is there any chance you could do a survey and at the end of the survey will give everyone like 20 pounds and give out your or like how do you need really like that?

So you could do that. You could follow everyone up with a survey.

Of like really like micro things that have come out.

You probably don't want to repeat the interviews though. Fuck your life. Interesting. What bar? Yeah, I mean, sorry, no carry on and

In the nightmare situation happens where we did a big interview. We did a big survey which cost hundreds of thousands really crazy.

We've excited.

I got some of the questions wrong.

Would like all things that we laid to found out when relevant and not asking that's all like massively relevant later.

Okay.

Doesn't feel nice.

and that's because you might have this pile of useless data or like

That feels actively not nice and yeah, it's because you it's because we set the survey up and ran the survey before we really understood the subject matter deeply hmm.

Which is where it had to be because of the timelines.

Like we didn't have time to understand subject matter and then do the survey. So I take a long time to set the survey out.

Do the project analyze the server results, right?

How do you overcome this right now? Like what is what do you do in that position?

example

we were lucky enough.

That would like our survey company had tagged like a South people having agreed to like a second follow-up.

So we had like a subset of people who are willing to like add one more onto one more question or like a few more questions.

Nice, so you can ask more people or like we ask them. Yeah, well.

and that's one solution another solution is

You don't.

Like you don't have a rigorous response you doing a couple more interviews.

And you just ask those people you focus on those things and yourself look. Yes, we didn't have like we ran our first set of interviews. Here's the conclusion. We didn't ask about this in the survey. It turned out to be important. So we ran additional interviews to get proper deep diving context on air. Here's how it looks.

um in particular, right if you're concerned now like you're like, oh, yes, there are these people are churning but like

Probably OCR would have made them turn less.

And that's maybe that's the theory or the hypothesis or whatever.

Fine, so then you can search up the subset of people who have churned.

Like some subserve those people.

you do a couple of follow-up interviews with them and you say

and then you have a slide right? So even though it doesn't all fit into the same like technical.

Single source of bit like database, right?

You can add a slide on after this.

that says

You know the talks about how like OCR is a significant, you know, it was a significant reason that these people Trend and they might be different people. You just learned through more interviews.

Yeah, how do you?

How do you align like let's say?

if you just talk to the client like on a more rolling basis when you just avoid avoid being up in the situation, can you just be like

His what we found out this is looking good. Like is there anything we kind of missing here?

Yes.

That always helps.

Extra communication with your client always helps. It doesn't work sold it.

So advisable you can't always talk to your client more.

Why?

look, like sometimes your clients have really busy and like

oh, that's why there's whatever like yeah. It's like, you know, I mean like your client the you're like true days day client might be like the ball.

We'll see. Yeah, right and he'll talk to you like

you got a six week project and he'll talk to you once three weeks in and I'll talk to you again six weeks in.

Okay, that makes sense. All right, and like we're working level clients like oh, yeah ocr's another worry. No one guess the shit about that Lamar. Hahaha and you're like cool and then you talk three weeks out on the CES like

answer anything about OCR on here.

That's a really key Focus for us.

You're staying.

What?

um

you know like I was over this like

No, she I think it makes it. Okay. This is this because you yourself are doing market research. You try to like figure out how Genie could improve market research. What's the um, yeah. I mean, it's kind of a

Let me let me ask you one more thing before I tell you the answer that question. I don't want to buy us here. Um

okay, when I went through our feedback, this was like

this was like the situation um on the on the board in this like we work. Um,

you know, I had a bunch of interviews Alex had a bunch of entities Oscar had a bunch of interviews and we sat in this room for like two and a half hours and read each other interviews and argued and chatted and wrote things and three circles around them and whatnot you and yeah, I was it was lovely and then by the end of it we had this like list of conclusions, um that will then turn into a deck the one I was just kind of showing you. Um, what is what is the tooling like once you once you start analyzing this stuff? Like, how do you how does it work on a

On like a rolling basis like there's all this shit going to Google Drive or Dropbox or do you have a big whiteboard or dual car things into stone tablets? What is the like

Yeah.

I like one night one night.

Hyundai

you can share things. So this this sort this level of chaos is a one note level of chaos. Okay if you wanted to

What you might do is you might turn this into slides, right?

You just do that like early on.

You you might formalize this, okay?

There and have like it depends I depends the extent what she needs an external stakeholder. I like serious it needs to be

but like what is the

what is the organism of the project that you're working on live? Like what is the like rolling updated repo of stuff that you guys will work off of?

Is it is it a deck or like?

Yeah, okay, probably.

So like the shed end State organisms.

But as we will for example due diligence is when we're taking notes. We have like one shared One Note.

It all have our own sections and we will take notes in there. And then you could like look at other people's notes for the same interview and that cost compare. Okay.

interesting

Cool. Okay. Nice. Um, yeah, I mean, okay so purpose for this. Um,

we we are exploring some other like

other examples of like research processes that we might be able to help with. Yeah.

We we didn't we're doing we didn't know right growth the moment making bank with the students but like long-term, they're just not like they're just not like cashed up. And so we what we need to if you like we need to find a market or like a research process where um, you know, you're dealing with people who are like cash rich in time poor, basically.

And one of the time rich in cash ball, which is kind of students are yeah, it's weird. It's it's because like what we found is that, you know, like doing this round of feedback actually like

One of our most core user groups like the guy said he's gonna jump off the bridge like it turned out to be a massive theme. Um, they're like part-time studying people. So they're like they have a job and then they're going to like night school or something at the same time because they need to get like a masters to to get another job and it means that like they have money from their job and they're all like incredibly stressed like some of these people were just like they were close like just melting down like, you know, like having to pass exams and then like one of them was like doing a neuroscience PhD and working as a full-time nurse because in America like you can't get funding up to a certain level for your PhD. So you go up you have to have a job at the same time and she was like, I like I'm so far behind and all the rest of it. So

we're doing this like research process. I just kind of

like kind of occurred to me that like that these sort of areas like

You know like I guess like of qualitative research where you you have to go off and like understand something like an industry or an individual like a problem or whatever and then like turn that into some sort of like narrative that used to like they'll let your strategy and I I ended up using a single pinpoint for a lot of hours. I can show this thing to you.

Oh.

Yeah is actually built for journalists.

Check this out.

But yeah, like

You know just has it these like all the transcripts and cools and I can like search stuff like I know saving saving time or whatever and like you can see the you know, the number of people that complain about this and then like, you know, I was like a pretty good way to like get these quotes out that went into the deck.

and so

yeah, I mean, yeah, what I'm sort of exploring really is like maybe maybe there's like a kind of Market opportunity for something that you know could help people like conduct this type of like Project based narrative research more efficiently and you know like be able to sort of

dump everything into like a repo and and be able to like just exercise like insights from all like ask it questions or like you're trying to get it to come up with themes or whatever like, you know, I tried it with some of our we looked at like private Equity at one point. I like tried it with some of the interview transcription and they're like kind of show you what that looked like so sort of

Yeah we go. Look.

yeah, like the sort of thing like what are

something that I don't know and then asking a question. It'll like we just asking out with like transcripts.

Here, you know you can kind of give you an answer like that, right?

shit

and so yeah, we're kind of wondering whether there's like an opportunity here to just like

I don't know.

spin out a bit of a like

search

Discovery tool or something just to help people like because you can you can Chuck and you Chuck in like market reports too or whatever like maybe a couple pitch Decks that kind of thing and just kind of

synthesize themes put out answers, whatever.

You know, I kind of want to see what's that?

I want I want that to be like, I don't know something where

tell me what you have a load of interviews have happened already. Yeah.

Like it's not as much use for the Consultants or whatever.

Where you have to like have someone sat in the room anyway.

Do you know what I mean like?

The point which you have to actually ask someone the question.

Your synthesizing yourself right out in real time.

So the marginal value is huge because

you look at the arm at least had some shitty associate or analyst like that's where every one of the interviews. Yeah.

You can kind of do this job a bit.

But there will be something why there's a load of these interviews that have been.

Done or a lot of conversations that have been done.

loads

But you as I like whatever your job is.

Like kind of want to Broad sense of it without having to pull through things.

And pick out the pain points or whatever.

Yeah.

Well, this is the interesting. I just spoke to another guy actually you um who works Consulting to you and one things we kind of viterated on she was like maybe this is actually more of a communication problem. So like what I just showed you that like, you know this like this this big

one second

wait

yeah, but this thing like

the difficulty was that not all of us have been present like we couldn't cover all the ground so he'd split up to do the interviews and and then it was like

I I knew what the themes were from mine, but I didn't like

you know, I I spoke to like we spoke to like I don't know 20 people and I'd spoke to ten of them and Alex spoke to or whatever it was and it was or the split was but like basically I haven't been privy to all conversations and so like

it was helpful to like test ideas because I had to then consume the stuff that they'd written too and it was like

Yeah, I guess like developing a shared framework was hard.

Um, and then indeed like when I presented this deck to the rest the team like people were asking questions that I hadn't considered and I just kind of popped the thing open and I was like, well, I don't know. Let's see like did anyone mention that like

Interesting. Yeah.

tonight

but it thought from working is what what I think there's got to be people who

want tons of qualitative research or like the thing that most naturally hits of me is I'm like

you

there's got to be people in a situation.

Someone else has done the research.

Or done the interviews.

And then you come in with a new question.

After the least interviews have been done.

and you want to infer from the things that have been said

by like 20 people Plus

War I don't know OCR is or whatever. Yeah, but like solving that without having to literally pick through the fucking transcript mmm

So like the answer has to be in what people have said.

But like come on who wants to go through. Yeah example size the better and the more sort of like not designed to answer the question interviews.

So, you know take my example of like the market size question like you don't need someone summarizing that

in a sense because like never had been instructed like find the market growth. I'm sorry, like pin people down fucking tell me the number. Yeah, then it was like it had its own box in my like

You know one night fine, that's pretty easy and then someone if afterwards could have gone if I got ill they could have gone through all my notes. I mean like five percent six percent five percent, right? Okay with that point you're basic you're just you're just basically surveying them right like you're not even it's yeah, but that's because the thing was appropriate right like yes like this the quest that the interview was totally matched the questions I was asking

but that will be a case where the interview won't quite ask the questions that you now want to ask.

Yeah, and you want to extract that from like 50 interviews that's where this data tool will come in immensely handy.

Yeah uses AI to like pick that out and like people would have touched my probably in the interviews. Were you guys know existed in first way we were joking that we were joking about how we could probably like use the interviews to just deep fake like a video or an audio file of somebody saying something.

we turn you know, we turn your conclusions into you know into into validated insights like

yeah.

Just like I don't know it's kind of funny though, like because I was one of the problems because like on point. I was just like

it's bit dodgy. But like I don't know I was like I had some I'd have some gut feeling about product or whatever maybe like, oh, I'm really doing here. He's just getting my co-founders on board. Like I'll just it doesn't really matter if I just like railroad these people into saying it like I just need to sound bites so that everyone agrees with me in the meeting. Um, you know, no so that's that's exactly how some of those design that interviews one.

Yeah, you were like, I'm pretty sure the way we're going to solve. This is by doing building this we'd prove that.

therefore you need to find someone say

because it's not like quantitative or whatever. You don't even need that many like you tend to use you have one person actually has that problem. Yeah.

He's quite in five times.

interesting

I wonder tractor.

Yeah.

People do that a lot. We find that with the students too. Like how some of these are tool. It's just like

Oh, I write a point in my essay that I just go find the data to the back it up. We'll go find the citation for it.

sad, yeah, but

I guess like I suppose arguably is an iterative process if you're like, I didn't find the data. So the conclusion was wrong that might be good. But I just wonder how often people conclude that.

You know.

Um, it's like that Pepperidge Farm meme which one?

Hey, hey, it's not usually the usual one is like it ain't much but it's honest work. Oh, yeah, it worked but it's much it's one of those and I was like me when I hand in my coursework. It's like it ain't much and it ain't honest.

What about

what about VC? Like do you when you're developing like an investment thesis like you must talk to a lot of Founders or like have to do like industry research or something. Is that like something where you find?

you know, you're getting the level and it's all a bit like explorative and

you know.

This is okay.

Really? Why?

It's all got there's no there's no there's no like.

I'm not interviewing like

a broad swath of Founders, you know, I mean you just talk to people I see what works and all that works.

And then my part of the house and like they'll have feces and all maybe I'll chase this one down and I have more set like they'll be more receptive to like a good thing along these line, right they already have and I've got this driving something on that. All these would have good a v maybe I chase these for a while John. I mean, I don't really need to summarize people's things because I'm not like

it sounds like you like you start with the conclusion and then you find the action rather than even the evidence.

He well you.

More you start with a hunch.

And you guys can see if you can find anything that like swings with that.

And looks good in general.

Do you know I mean like yeah.

Like I have a hunch of like I reckon at the moment high end.

design, like interior design stuff

probably is a really good way.

Of like selling shit online because you get really high order values and people are quite trusting if it works if it's like a good idea.

So that's probably one that's suitable for digital marketing because you just like

you can spend a ton of wiring customers and still make profit.

That's my hunch, right?

and part that I'm just like

Guild owns a company that did that and made Fox tons of money

So then I was like, okay cool. That worked really well for those reasons.

Now I will go find other companies that look like that what other companies like that?

Well, there's one company that's good. There's like current.

Let's chase that down. Yeah.

So yeah, it's a bit.

It's a bit whack.

interesting

Do you have to go back over calls with Founders? Because one things I thought right like we looked like PE is an industry we

We kind of like we had this thesis that we were chasing about why how we could be helpful.

And it wasn't right, but then this other company came out later, he built a product that we definitely could have built.

Who did really well who didn't really well off the back of it and like I don't know if it was confirmation bias. When I looked at these interviews again. I was just like, you know, the you know, the fucking signs were there. I was like, you know, like look through these things and I was like, um, you know, he basically was just like

It'll he said something like um, what was it? He was like, yeah, it's all just reading a bunch of stupid documents. Like I just need to like get details out to put into my model or whatever and unlike we had this other idea about how we're gonna be helpful. And so we just completely missed another and like

It made sense in hindsight. I was like, oh shit like that, you know.

That was the actually this is the thing. I show you here.

Yeah, three that day two extraction would be really helpful.

So I I was doing this is the blip side. Sorry, so I was thinking purely searched but there's another side of things which is like

I was battling a company crew like a bit ago. Yeah.

Like how do I value this company?

And so one of the ways I did North up you just

oh, I'll pull up my dag. It was actually quite it was actually more rigorous than most stuff. I do. Oh, that's it.

And it wasn't fucking knowledge.

It was like meet garbage.

Um, yeah, I was frankly shocked. So this worked.

Or even I was even showing how to someone else. I've actually already sanitized. It wasn't.

Okay. Sure. Yeah, it's better normal. Yeah.

Okay.

see that

Yeah, nice.

Yeah, so

Basically, I did a lot of different methods.

DCS not interesting

What I did here is I used similar companies.

Okay.

Right, and I actually did use an AI tool for this.

Oh, which one?

Oh.

It was comparables.ai.

And I used it to find like the companies that are similar.

Oh, yeah, you know there's another one's local similar web. He's out sometimes.

Yes, I used it to find these bad boys. Mmm.

And then I used Google to pull out a load of different metrics of theirs.

so like Revenue

like valuation

earnings Etc.

Yeah, so they could build like a benchmark, right?

So you do like, you know company.

So you I found one company in particular super fucking similar.

Like what valuation do they have?

Yeah, there's one. Um.

Visa service called profit well for our staff metrics and you can just do like a benchmarking and it'll like

they have SAS data from so many companies and they just like

it'll just tell you it'll be like your attention is 50th percentile something.

yes, there's another there's a

one for consumer goods that I use called charm dot AI interesting Charmed up IO sorry.

Those d2c goods but the same concept interesting.

well

Okay, that sounds like VCS like slightly different kind of fish. Um if I'm interested in this like Consulting thing like

It feels like the people I kind of want to talk to you.

I think

So I spoke to someone else who worked me Kenzie actually all the people are speaking to you Mackenzie.

but

yeah, they

it sounds like

the

compliance and like purchasing rules at these places are like fucked and getting any.

Getting anyone's even try out a tool or whatever is like we're gonna require like reams of it approval. Oh, yeah. So my feeling was like there's loads of independent and like Boutique people where it's probably just like, you know, a one-man band or you know a little shop or something of you know, whatever. He might be a bit more like a meaningful.

um

Do you know anyone who?

Like how like would you recommendation be for like I guess getting in touch with someone like that.

You know, I mean like deadly squat Consulting has six or seven people and there's like one CEO who just makes all the decisions.

But only consultancies they're like that. I know that people who I know one of the heads of rbr.

They quite small.

Like research fun. Oh, yeah.

Very small that probably got 20 people.

I think maybe offered chart.

Maybe

I mean like yeah, I want to see like any anyone he's anyone who's kind of in the firing line here. Just kind of curious to see whether it's like a

violent issue or not

I'm gonna lie on Lincoln.

That would be cool.

Should I would you want to talk to someone in leadership or someone like middle management? Probably at this point one of those analysts are Associates that gets like screwed by this on a daily basis.

Exactly. Yeah.

I'm she's telling them I think oh nice. Yeah, that'd be fun. I didn't think I didn't think yeah. No one like Perino and CBC. You're like they've got to be like that. I use you. Someone senior you like to know how to do the job. Yes. It wakes up in the morning like, you know falls into his mind like screw the dog.

I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to blow your Jasper anything either like yeah, just I mean anyone's not yeah, exactly. Yeah, like oh, yeah, I'll give you my cheat contacts first. Thank you to see the please the pink sheets first. Yeah. Um, you can you can find you can buy an expensive food channel for that.

That's very kind of you.

That's let me

we actually now right now.

No.

It's called quit. It turns out I asked all this message.

In May what we've been there.

Yeah, hey.

You've been doing well.

Would you fancy getting climbing soon?

Hey, I'm seriously dude. I'm the this is so kind of you you even putting yourself at Harm's Way for my

also, I have a

running

a

And AI startup, is that what you guys yeah.

is

to

to do his new

and next product

is

Okay also have a minute running an AI startup. He's trying this is so transparent that I'm not actually come back. But yeah, also I haven't made running here trying to capture people and types of people like insulting research Etc inform that product that any chance you ever chapter like 20 minutes.

That would be perfect. Yeah stunning. Thank you.

Massive. Okay. Well fingers crossed my

five months of airing heavenly

too much dude. I need an autopilot for like I feel like that sometimes I'm just like

I don't know. I I like he's just yeah, sometimes you just I don't know what my thing my biggest issue is.

if

Occasionally, I'm like no, I'll be better. I'm gonna reply to people I reply to everyone.

A lot of people and then you get even more messages.

I want to just the Beast.

it's the be

AST just gonna say no

yeah, and I have like the issues right like

I have plenty of social life, right? Like I have what I want to like be friends with people and do things and like cool stuff. Mostly. It's like

works out

and so I'm like, I don't need to feed the beast of replying to people more being more popular because I'm not as shit shitty reply.

Because then I like burn a lot of my life.

In this Loop of constant communication being a good friend. Yeah. Yeah. No it's and

Doesn't doesn't move doesn't shift the bottom line.

You can the other thing you can always just drive them to to like a meet up or an event or whatever.

If you can spare time, that's always the other approach. You can just be like

that like if you get a hey, how's it going? You just like good. Let's get drinks on this date that this place like, you know, yeah.

Yeah, that's good. And now that also why I like quite like I don't want a while.

So if you like moving jobs and stuff and I have been

busy, but I've been like I like doing dinner parties that exact reason.

So let me reach out to people and then see them.

Do something nice and they might keep myself as a relevant and interesting friend and people's lives. Yeah, you know like efficient.

and birds one stone

That's why I look for in my social life.

socialize faster better harder

That's why that's why you're you're only well known loser with no friends.

Mr. Cool

this guy

Did this guy um speaking off do you want to get drinks? Oh, and I'm back in London.

Yeah, absolutely. Love to I'm gasping for drink. I'm only about I'm back.

week of the

I'm back on the 4th of

November and I'm off the drinks. Why do you Friday the 11th?

I might be going to Poland.

But I don't know.

Wow.

Or somebody didn't what are you doing for guy fawks? There's anything going on.

Oh guy falls. So Rogue.

Oh, no, I yeah, I saw the message. I don't know. I'm going to um

I mean Romania.

Legend yeah, it's pretty random, um who's doing things for Halloween

probably you see

What are your options right now?

I actually have no options at this year.

Peak it's tough. You can organize something.

That's my thinking. That's my thinking at this point. I'm actually like I might organize something but it's getting quite late, right?

I think if you did it like in the next day or two.

I might have to.

What you supposed to dinner party or something and then if there is something else going on you can just go for the drinks after dinner.

Good idea, actually, yeah three on it. Maybe after that.

pull the

pull work pull the Band-Aid off rip it.

Oh one nice now. All right. Nice. All right, let's do drinks on the fifth and a lot. Yeah, I'd love to I'd love to um, let me

Just just I hope you would.

not I'll pay you fair value for

your time, but I just don't believe it's worth anything. So well, I'm I can pay you fair value and you can pay me fair value and we can cash flow that and it comes out to a nice round zero so excited.

All right, see that bye it.
