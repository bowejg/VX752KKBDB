# Amy Bennett-Thompson

Jack Bowen: Well, nice. Thanks for taking the time to speak to me. Yeah, no problem. Awesome. Brilliant See, I guess like pups the cool really is just to kind of get a get a bit of an idea of you know how you getting a genie how you find it and how we can sort of improve it. We're working on the next part of our our roadmap right now. So kind of interesting talking about a bunch of, I guess, like conceptual issues around like problems you might face? And then like, what kind of product specific stuff but like what's working and what isn't? So yeah, I guess like straight off the bat, it'll be really useful to just kind of hear hear a bit more about you and what you're studying what using Genie for and, and how you found this really?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, so um, alright, so I'm currently a PhD student doing physics at Cambridge. My work is in condensed matter physics. I do mostly theory with a lot of traditional self. But of course, I need to always read papers on experiments just to keep updated with the status of the field, get results from competitors, collaborators, and well get information for all the papers I have to write. So I had first of all, the application from Hacker News. Someone posted that link there. And just from the start, it sounded like something would be amazing. And that would be very helpful for me. And so I have used it intensively a few times. So I would, I would use it, like continuously for a couple of days or even a week, and then I'll just leave it because it got a bit too frustrating, or I got the bare minimum that I thought that it would help me with and then I switched to other methods.

Jack Bowen: Okay, so yeah, so you said you got frustrated and switch? Like what, what kind of frustrated you wasn't what wasn't working?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Okay. One thing that I hate the most,

Jack Bowen: this is brilliant. Do you want you can share your screen.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Lets me. You know how, when you open a document, it says you want to see the overview. Okay, I want to see the overview as well as why notes are the project. Why is this not a thing? Why do I have to consistently go from the overview, close that thing, open the notes, manipulate the notes, then go back to the overview. And that is just very frustrating. Okay. Okay. Another thing I really struggle with this is a lot of the documents I have to go through, they have lots of like theoretical notations, math, mostly, and the parsing of math notations. It's difficult, I understand it is super difficult. But one thing that would be very helpful if there is the ability to capture, like an image of, say, the definition of a lemma or a theorem or, or like a proof or something, and just to capture that and then copy the label, which usually it's like the first couple lines that says lemma x, and then just have the photo because that would be the most precise again, the most useful thing for me, I want to be able to have that copied into the notes.

Jack Bowen: Do you want to share your screen I'd love to see like an example of one of the papers Yes you.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Unless you what's going on? It's not sharing, is it?

Jack Bowen: No, it's the it's the fifth one in from the left. It looks like a little square with an up arrow in it. Yeah. Okay. We can go and zoom.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Try that again. How do I cancel Siri...

Jack Bowen: To go on Zoom?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah

Jack Bowen: sorry, it's been a year you got that

Amy Bennett-Thompson: It tells me please wait for the host to start the meeting.

Jack Bowen: Oh, weird. We owe you All right.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: isn't showing anything at all?

Jack Bowen: It says you've started?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I haven't actually use any of this since we switched to in person work?

Jack Bowen: Yeah, I can't see it. You know what, let's just we can just talk it through. And I'll just kind of use my imagination.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Okay. That's why three dots. I just recently switched to think of one, two. And it's not like all right. So I'm doing some work right now on something called Point Clouds. This is a way of representing atomic structures. And it's very useful because we care about disordered and highly complicated structure configurations with 10s of 1000s of vertices. And to represent them, we need to use structures that allow us to distinguish between different atomic like structures in a way that also measures some kind of distance between them. And that can definitely distinguish them. And so one thing I've been working on is invariance for point clouds. And that's just basically math. And so to do that, I'll be looking at different definitions of metrics, different ways of defining convergence and stuff. So I tried to use that with Jenai earlier on. But it was very annoying and didn't work super

Jack Bowen: well, so you trying to get definitions, definitions of

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I kind of what I wanted to do was like build a collection of different pieces of information and connect them to each other. And the way I do research and the way A lot of fathers, I know do research is that we have to read an insane amount of papers. Every day, I say I start my day by reading papers from the archive from Google Scholar, recommendations sent to me by colleagues, like every single day. And generally, it's, it's at least 10 papers a day, this is like, the smallest amount they have to go through. And so what I need is not a thorough reading of everything, I need to get the minimal useful subset of like all the information that's in each of these papers. Without like, using AI tools, I have to like rely on reading the abstract and looking at the figures and then taking snapshots of them and just copying them on in other tools. The tool I'm using right now is actually obsidian. Yeah, yeah. And so it is good, but it is very much a manual process. And like, a lot of the actions I do, they can be very helpfully optimised. One thing I like about Denise is actually the copying of figures, the extraction of the figures that is super useful, because otherwise they have like zooming and taking screenshots, and then capturing the text. You know, it did not only did one thing, which just allow me to get all the figures, each figure with the caption copied over. That alone would be a very useful thing, if I could just download that, like, download a markdown file with just figures and, and and their caption.

Jack Bowen: Do you want do you want them in Markdown? So you can put them in obsidian? Right?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Well, because searching It's a bit hot here on internet, like I can't search or combine things. Oh, it would be great if a single document could belong to multiple projects in a reference way. So it is stored one way I can add my notes like up on any of the linked copies. Because it's sort of my like, I want a project to be like a paper. And why paper I'm writing a single research project and they have lots of overlaps. So I would have liked to have the ability to reference a document that I annotated like this that I have summarised something in another project without having to copy it over. That will be very useful.

Jack Bowen: Okay, so you want to be able to like, yeah, I guess link linking stuff together. It sounds like you're kind of almost using it. You want to use it like obsidian?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, but like, my workflow is definitely heavily influenced by the abilities of obsidian. But the thing that I want is to be able to use the AI aspect is summarization aspects.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. I have a question. Actually, um, you said that obsidian was like a very manual process, like, what are the what are the manual parts of using it? Like, what what some? Yeah.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Okay, so when? Okay, let me start from the beginning with you. So I clicked the link to the article. Yeah, I have to, to open it. And then I can read the title, the author's if I have. So I have these tags per author, which is a bit excessive, but it's how I keep track of the different research groups. And so I tag all the authors by the format that I buy the naming format of, of actually Zotero. So I will also add the document to zero like that's actually my first step to go get the title COVID The authors and then I go to the abstract, make heading for abstract and copy over the abstract have to remove all like when they close they also have to have to read all the line breaks so that it's actually like reasonable paragraphs.

Jack Bowen: When line breaks from what the from the

Amy Bennett-Thompson: the copy from Claudia is It's

Jack Bowen: Oh, like copying it from the PDF. And the thing is really annoying.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, it's usually always, almost always in PDF, because when you go through the draft papers, mostly archive, you don't actually get like an HTML thing that you can copy from easily. And there is this very annoying

Jack Bowen: Okay, and you're doing all this in like, Genie, or no, this is obsidian, isn't it?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, this is the manual obsidian process. Sometimes, they would mention quartz or something like that. And then I would have to look through for a GitHub link or any other like place where they're placing their code or the data. And then I would follow the link, or create a new record sent there is this source code or this data from this paper link to it? And then go to follow the link and see if it's something useful for me or not?

Jack Bowen: Yeah. So

Amy Bennett-Thompson: with this subject isn't something I need to look for, for specific upcoming project? Or is this just something that will be in like a literature review?

Jack Bowen: Got it? Got it. Okay. Really interesting. And, okay.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: This is like, the manual thing that happens every day. And then when I have to actually do some writing, or look up some relevant information, I have to go and search through the stuff I have. And that search process is also very, like, if, if I could have like, not necessarily perfect summaries, but searchable summaries, like just necessarily something that I would use directly when whenever I sit, but just to get resources that I am looking for at that moment. Searching through many hundreds of PDFs is really is really a pain. So having summaries just as something to search through, when I'm looking for references, that's something that would be helpful. So, one thing I want to ask is, are there any plans to have the ability to export like you select? Let's say you asked for 2000 words summaries of every single document in this project, Can Can I do that, and then have that exported with just something that name of the names the document link to the document on tonight, or there's no source or something and then the generated summary, that would be like, so helpful. I think

Jack Bowen: our view on this is that like, like we want, we want people to like live in our platform, like we want them to use it as like their sort of main hub. And so we're like faced with this decision, like, we can make it easier to put things into other platforms. Or we can cover more of the functionality of those platforms so that people don't feel the need to and so like our preference is like kind of to attack it from the other end. So you know what, from what I'm hearing from you, like, obsidian is nice because you can like, create these links and you can you know, search all of your notes and you there's this like, you know, nice the linking reduces like duplication and stuff so like, you know, a better solution to me would be like to incorporate those things in our platform. So that you don't have to use

Amy Bennett-Thompson: it. Yeah, that that would actually be helpful.

Jack Bowen: Right. And it Yeah, it's an interesting, it's an interesting idea, right. It's like, um, it's almost sort of to do with like obsolescence. It's kind of like if we, you know, if we, if we become, if we become like, a point that you transit through in your way to obsidian and obviously, I don't know, it's kind of hard for us to like, you probably feel like you're getting a bad deal if you had to pay for the tool. And you only use it to do that every so often. If you paid for the tool, and yeah,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: honestly, I wouldn't, because this is actually something that I can pay for with my

Jack Bowen: grants. Oh, interesting. Okay,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: yes. So I actually had an argument with the people who manage my grants. Yeah, this kind of tool is definitely something like I can get fun. So yeah.

Jack Bowen: Have you ever recommend a genie to everyone? Anyone?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I did. I recommended it to my supervisor, my PhD supervisor. And I think he tried it a bit, but he's a bit too old school. Okay. He has like, all these printouts and stuff. Yeah, that's.

Jack Bowen: And like, how did you? How did you pitch it? Like? What was the chat? Like? Were you kind of like, how did Genie? Well, two questions like one? How did it come up in the conversation? And like, two, how did you describe it?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Um, so I talked to my supervisor very early on, like when I first joined on the platform, and so I think back then you didn't even have like this letter cert, I did not the search is better than it used to be. But we were discussing one of my past papers that I was writing at the time. And so I was showing him my notes and my summaries on the different groups who are working on the like, in our area and go through the differences between their work and our work and suggesting a structure for for the paper, specifically the literature review, part of the introduction kind of thing. And he was impressed by my organisation and thoroughness. Especially as I was new to the field. So he was like, how, how did you get such an understanding so fast? My answer was, I found this tool and it was very helpful in getting wide overview and being able to identify key papers that I wanted to read and investigated. Then I should go to the website and

Jack Bowen: Okay, um

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Okay, so pacify I stopped is that I actually was in summer school. Okay. So that was for three and a half weeks. I also give talks at two conferences, so lots of travel and good stuff. But also part of it is features. After generating summaries and stuff, I still had to copy them, copy them over to obsidian and do all of that manual processing. Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to properly link the different pieces of information I gathered. From this point on like the papers I have the different projects. And it's also you know, how you can select a piece of text from a document and then asked for it to be summarised, or either copied directly to the notes. Yeah. What do you want to be able to do is to copy it link to a specific subsection of the notes. So if you have different headings to be able to copy to a specific place that would make parsing the information from the different papers much more convenient.

Jack Bowen: Got it? Interesting. Okay, so it sounds like to summarise there like, you kind of weren't really reading papers for bed anyways. So sort of that like there wasn't really strong, meaty need to use it. And then even though you were getting the summaries, there was this like friction, getting them into obsidian. And that kind of outweighed the value of being able to do it, though.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, if cooking like got much easier or searching much easier, or even just like being able to highlight something in the summary and say, copy this into the summary for for this other project.

Jack Bowen: Yeah,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: that would be super useful.

Jack Bowen: Oh, interesting. Um, gosh, I have so many questions. This is this is a very, this is a very candid interview.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I hope that didn't get better, because it would be so useful for me, if I could actually do this, if I could have actually useful search functionality. And even like, not not so great summarization.

Jack Bowen: What are you trying to good? What do you what do you when you search for stuff? Like, what are you trying to? What like, give me an example of like, can you give me an example of like, what the, what is you're trying to achieve?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Okay, so sometimes when I search for something, what I'm searching for is different examples of something. For example, we have these things called typological classifications, and there are different ways to classify the topology of, of the trunk structure of something. And so there are different methods or different ways to classify the different kinds of topology. When thinking I would look for is, if I say, particular classification method. This is like having, but with her, we'll be searching for specific tools that results in different ways of classification. So, for example, I would search for Wilson loops, I would search for DFT, high symmetry points, all these different methods that would then give me papers that use these methods to generate different classes. And then I would copy all of these, put them in this heading of topology classifications methods of these pupils method of these papers, I'm done, I would have to go manually and read the papers or read the summaries, the papers to see which ones are novel, which ones are just extending previous works without the two new materials without actually generating the new classes or types of classifications. So this is one type of research that observes that they have to often do. Another type is just kind of experimental results. So I would search for material, I would search for a property. Sometimes it would be searching for, like a measured value between between A and Zed. And so I would have to search for the key term for the property or the material that I'm looking for. And then read through the papers that mentioned this and eliminate the things that are not quite describing what I mean. We can come interested in lots of papers, just like we've mentioned and material on the property in their introduction or the official view and then go on to actually be about results that are not relevant at all. So having the ability to get the summary that eliminates this kind of false positive candidate is very time saving.

Jack Bowen: Okay, Oh,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: yeah. And sometimes I would be looking by person. So I research group that has been working on something for quite a few years, I would need to go through the papers of the main investigator, their students and their main collaborators try to get this overview of their work and follow the branches that I am actually interested in. Getting, like most of the papers, selecting the few ones that aren't relevant, getting the people who did the work with this person, and then getting their papers, looking at this guy's papers, like the

Jack Bowen: web of Yeah, that's really interesting. Wow. It's so funny. You're like taking me back to my undergrad and masters now? DFT and all of that. I remember. I remember studying all that stuff. Did you ever come across this guy? What's his name?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Who is He? Is he the Quantum Espresso guy.

Jack Bowen: This guy he he worked on? Yeah, like theoretical stuff like theoretical material science. And he. He's interested in like he like, I don't know, did all these like theoretical calculations for like, perovskites and stuff, and it's quite quite impressive at the time.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he uses is one of the contributors to Yeah, that's actually some of the stuff for experimental workers. It's some of the collaborators.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, I got I got lectured by him. He's a bit of a legend. Actually. He was like, yeah, pretty cool. Yeah. Cool. Okay. Well, I guess like back on the product stuff. And this is so interesting. So like, because, okay, I, I know what the problems are with our search. Like, I'm curious, like, what have you noticed? Like, how does Where does Genie search, like, not work?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: It doesn't work for math. Okay. Sometimes I would be searching for a term and it gives me results from like, the references. Yeah, which is not what I want. Oh, talking about references, it would be very helpful. If, if I could, like, go through references when I'm reading your paper, Mark references to be added later. So just have a cue of just list of references. And then when I'm ready, I could go through them, select something and say, Let's fetch this paper?

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Oh, that would be cool. Interesting. Um, okay. What? And what else? Have you noticed? So like, I remember, you talked about searching for like, authors as well. And headers, like do you find that the results are good, or?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I think that search in general, when it comes to scientific stuff, it's, it's very, it's very, like very much more of an art than something very trivial. You have to like play with the words to get the results you actually want. Okay, you know, what will be helpful if if I could pass papers to classify them to like, this paper actually generates a machine learning model or this paper does some DFT calculations and reports on their results or has experimental results reported? I mean, I understand that would be maybe difficult, because maybe you can try to train a model to just classify papers. So I'm having by their nature, because they have these introductions and these literature reviews in every single paper, when I search for something, either too generic or something that is actually interesting results very frequently instead of the original source. I would get the results from sources that describe this result or the advancement in their introduction or in their, in their literature review, or even in like their conclusions with competing results. So it would be helpful if, if I could search only in, say, the results sections. Or if I could sort papers by the number of citation. So I don't keep getting very recent, but not very useful papers instead of the original, often cited papers,

Jack Bowen: okay, I'm right. Yeah, I shouldn't be there. The other question is really?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Can Fuwa? It's like, I don't know, if you have been to PhD students meetings. That's like the number one complaint?

Jack Bowen: I guess it kind of it kind of depends, right? Because like some some of the ones I spoke to you like, especially in like, I don't know, some fields. They're like, the they're so experimental that their work is just like 90% of their time is actually just in the lab, I guess. But yeah.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, that's fair. For theorist and mutational people. It is unfortunately the case that most of your days are spent reading.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Okay. You know, what I have you had a chance to look at the new version 1.0.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I'm not really so I was planning to use it before this meeting. But writing takes so much time.

Jack Bowen: Let me show you because I think some of the things you mentioned, we've actually fixed a few of those issues. So I can kind of give you a quick, quick web around of it. Let's see. Oh, that's not very one. Nope, sorry. I have like so many tabs open.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Like that is very nice. How do I get access?

Jack Bowen: You can well you have a subscription right now I think so if you just head over to our website, you can just sign up straight to it. And then like also you said the stuff that equations I don't think it was a problem for you. But you can actually you can you can do latex now in our in our editor so you can just do like like an inline equation or a ziploc one so I don't know if you Yeah, if you want to put in like a you know definition for something or whatever it is you're you're working on you can kind of you know fully supports all of this. All these like Latech some ones and everything and they can do all your tech stuff and definition

Amy Bennett-Thompson: a way to change the boundaries of the captured image.

Jack Bowen: No, unfortunately not. You can. Okay, you can I, if that happens, I normally use the snipping tool. So just kind of go in like this. And I'll just like screenshot it. And then and then I'll just like upload it as an image here. So,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: wait, this doesn't used to work? Well, I think the image is this new.

Jack Bowen: You can actually do that. And the old one. Oh, yeah. Probably wouldn't Republic about that release? Yeah, you can, you can upload those. And then you can kind of set them up, however you want to delete that.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: This is something I really wanted to do.

Jack Bowen: Nice. Yeah, I mean, I yeah, it's just a lot nicer, really. And then with the linking stuff to like, you can create these dynamic links back to like, where, where things came from. So you know, if you want to, like highlight this text, you can do that there's like a shortcut to come on each. And then once you've got it, you just kind of, you can click on your highlights, after you've annotated the paper, and just click this, the plus here, and then I'll just add it straight in. And we made the links just like free text. So you can just open those up. And you can also make your own too. So if I like copy a link to this bit of text, and, you know, I like to use it to make kind of make like index like kind of contents pages, if that makes sense. So he said, like, like, here, I'll make like, I'll make a free text link out of this. And then this will be like my sort of index page for whatever it is. And then I'll just open that up. And it will just kind of take me to that paper. And you're

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I am actually excited to flash

Jack Bowen: starting. That's good. That's pretty good. And I'll show you how we improve the search.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: References handles.

Jack Bowen: Oh, in the overview. In the Summary, yeah. We took them out. We're gonna put them back in though, but we're making them better. We've been working with this collaborator, like, here's the scores that you got. So this is our, like, classification now on on these different errors, because it's quite a hard problem. Identifying semantic elements. And

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I think, add more things like definition of like, okay, piece of pseudocode, or, let's say, mathematical theory, or proof or something that would be very nice. Oh, what

Jack Bowen: like, how do you mean, like a sort of? What sort of thing you're looking for, like a

Amy Bennett-Thompson: new classification? So if you could,

Jack Bowen: oh, yeah, we got in the equation.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, crazy. It's not really that classification for things.

Jack Bowen: It's, I think this is an example of it. Maybe? Yeah. So it's like

Amy Bennett-Thompson: that. Yeah, that sounds like a very hard problem. Yeah, it takes parsing. Because, you know, people use all kinds of different libraries.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, it's a weirdly difficult problem getting taxed out of PDFs. But yeah. Cool. Um, is there anything you think I should have asked you? That will be useful to know.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah. I'm very lucky that I have a place for everything.

Jack Bowen: Do you know people that do like there? Is it somewhat common to have some people to be like working at the same time or?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Well, Kimbra it's yours. It's very intense. So yeah, most people can't really for the time to spend on working. Now that makes sense. So we do have lots of startups. So people with a PhD students or postdocs. They're usually involved in startups as advisors or as part time workers. Yeah. Do you also like Teach? That's

Jack Bowen: that's a good point as well. Yeah. Cool. Um,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: oh, actually, this is very important. I want to be able to present the the overview. So, within genetic, if I can show it to like, my supervisor or something,

Jack Bowen: oh, what like

Amy Bennett-Thompson: I summarise the overview. I would like to be able to, like, presented nicely. You can Well notice the notes.

Jack Bowen: Specifically, what these birds the sections,

Amy Bennett-Thompson: know the notes like this. Yeah, this kind of thing.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, tricky. You can close this. I mean, if you want to share with someone, you can always just close this, all this stuff off and then just like, kind of show you so that's about as fullscreen as it gets. Yeah. What are you trying to do you mean like a PowerPoint? Almost like a?

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, like if I don't need to, like sell exported, but just there are lots of like these tools that allow you to view markdown files in a more presentation friendly.

Jack Bowen: Oh, what are they called? Okay.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Is there okay, there are markdown slides there is there is more markdown presentation ecosystem. Yeah, more common ones.

Jack Bowen: Whoa, this is quite cool, actually.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, so if there is a button or something I could press and then just have this nicer view. generated.

Jack Bowen: Oh, wow. That's really cool.

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Lots of filter tools. There is slipper? Slip. Yeah, but that's like an app. It's without an E Yeah. So IPPR Yeah, so it's an electron app. But it's also kind of nice that's so cool.

Jack Bowen: I didn't realise you can do this. Yeah, I always have to like my my other co founder is like really protective of the code or on the notepad so if I ever want to add anything after chat to him like you couldn't get him to add in you know, like linebreaks I ended up doing or is it

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, I got the create a new one point Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, say I already have an account and then put your email in and then it should work. Let me just I'll just confirm that you still have the subscription I'm pretty sure you do

Amy Bennett-Thompson: Yeah, brilliant. Thanks for telling me about the new app.

Jack Bowen: Starting bye bye
