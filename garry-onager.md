there are the tools that I use in several platforms on online communities.

0:06
I used the focus vision, I used the ipsos, I used the other other tools I remember using the tools that they provide are very limited, very limited because they do not they are not subtle, you know?

0:23
You I must in my case you know, I I see when there is a type of the quote doesn't appear in the list.

0:35
They put complicated and they forgot to put the A is complicated.

0:42
it doesn't appear in the least so or the plural or the gender differentiation.

0:48
You should put you know, you must search in your imagination.

0:54
Well where is the root of the word that always appear every time?

0:59
The respondent would like to express this idea, you know?

1:04
And this is the the expression and the other point is that the This is the main bone.

1:11
This for me this is the main point.

1:13
This is the main point.

1:14
I do not collect every every answer.

1:17
When I use a filter in Excel in Excel five, it's very difficult to collect every every every answer, you know.

1:28
So so the the distribution or the or the organization of the data is not easy.

1:37
You must go deep read all the because this allows us not to read every every every every quote.

1:46
You know.

1:47
So this speeds up should should speed pick up the the collection putting order in the database, you know.

1:58
This is difficult.

2:00
This is difficult because there are synonyms that are at the same time some respondents use some word for defining you know easy and the other says convenient and the other says but it's the same idea or very close idea.

2:21
So is difficult to obtain a proper, you know because you realize reading which are the words the other bunnies.

2:34
Sometimes I can put the category categories are are very simple, very straightforward.

2:44
But most of the time the categories are discovered, you reading the quotes, you read the goods and you realize that this is different from what the the other people said, what the other respondents said and you realize and you put two categories apart or to kind of quotes apart one from each other.

3:06
So it's a kind of you you need to be I I even in this situation I use I find it very useful because it allows me to know if the respondent is using these kind of words I can put in the search, we're searching the brand, you know Mcdonald's Mcdonald's hamburger or you know, I can put these names and I find the rough landscape of what is happening.

3:45
It sounds like it sounds like it's kind of, it sounds like what you're saying is that it's there are some fairly rudimentary tools out there that are connected to like data collection platforms that help you like search for words and stuff but they don't actually you still have to read it.

4:13
Excuse me.

4:15
you still have to read the all of the data in order to get like a real depth of understanding about, about what's going on.

4:26
What about I mean, what about these like tagging tools?

4:29
Because like I don't know what isn't it useful to be able to, you know, if we take this one for instance, like you know, to be able to go through, go through an interview and and like target, you know like this.

4:48
Yeah.

4:49
this this is very interesting.

4:51
I find it very useful because you know, in this you have the wording and you have the frequency of mentioned and so you can say, well this is very important for the consumer.

5:02
People are very interested in this dimension of the product or I don't know, this is very relevant in their lives or I know, you know, you can, I do not use this tool, I find it that I I used but only one at a time, you know, only one.

5:28
Only one at a time, it's very small.

5:35
Yeah, I can say pinpoint, Okay pinpoint.

5:40
I analyze pinpoint has this people mentioned pain points and they say, you know, I I do not have that is very powerful and very interesting to have all the landscape, you know, pain points is one.

5:59
The other is I don't know, I don't know, packaging, the other is motivation.

6:07
The other is, I don't know interest in buying the product.

6:14
you know if you can put everything together and have a picture of what's happening in this market, we don't know initially what are the key words of the key concepts that will structure the market.

6:32
Yeah, okay.

6:36
I think one thing as well and like I'm curious what you think of this like like I think I think this tagging, I think this tagging stuff is interesting.

6:50
one thing I wonder though is like whether Whether whether it would actually help somebody work 10 times better.

7:04
Sorry, whether like this type of capability would actually help somebody work like 10 times better.

7:11
Whether this is like whether this is like quite a good solution or like a really good solution?

7:18
Yes.

7:20
Yeah, I find that is useful if you put because we do have this more or less this too and I use something more primitive, you know?

7:42
No, no, it's the word searching in where the Microsoft word for example or the filters in X files, you know there, I can't I need to search 1x1.

8:00
Yeah, let me put it this way.

8:05
What how much would you pay for a tool that did this?

8:10
Like how much, I mean this is a product already exists, like how much how much would you pay for this capability?

8:16
like what what sort of value do you think it would like provide you if you were able to like tag stuff in a interface like this?

8:24
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I am paying for?

8:31
congratulations, application, similar to google translate but better more specialized, I am paying 101 €100 160 euros or something.

8:51
It's a reference for a year or a month.

8:57
Is that a year or a month?

9:01
Sorry.

9:02
For for one year?

9:04
one year.

9:05
Yeah, but this is more sophisticated and I cannot if if I can use this for several projects along the year I think that is, I know I cannot give you an amount but I think probably I it works one country, I don't know, I don't know, it's difficult but let me let me tell you something completely rough, you know.

9:41
But 11 country per project, the usage of this.

9:46
If I have, I could pay because this this doesn't change very much.

9:55
This increases the my capabilities of doing a report, preparing the report.

10:02
I need to check anyway, it allows me to do it faster.

10:08
Right?

10:10
So if it allows me to do it faster, it I should pay 200 per project.

10:22
You know, if I obtain a really powerful results, the output is really allows me to dedicate less time to this project, you know, and I can prepare the report very rapidly.

10:37
Right?

10:39
Yeah.

10:39
Some projects, the analysis is sometimes is half of the, of the price, you know, I have half of the my budget, you know, And how much is your budget for a typical project?

11:03
Well, I have low budget, that is €500.

11:13
And bigger projects are 300, years.

11:23
Three wait 5 500 to 3000.

11:26
4000.

11:29
3000.

11:31
Yeah.

11:33
Okay, interesting.

11:36
I am a small player.

11:39
Yeah, no, I mean that's yeah.

11:43
How long is the project last if someone's paying you?

11:45
4000 for a project, how long would that be?

11:50
one week.

11:51
A week.

11:51
Okay.

11:52
Week, less less than one week.

11:55
For first four days.

11:57
For 4000 4000?

12:01
No, 4000 is a month, month.

12:04
Got it.

12:07
400 500 is a week.

12:11
Yeah.

12:12
One thing that's interesting.

12:14
I've heard this from some other people too.

12:16
You talk about using a tool on like a per project basis.

12:20
Is that a common way of charging out?

12:25
Is that a common like payment plan that people arranged?

12:30
Because I I've heard I've heard other people talk about renting software for like running a focus group.

12:40
Yes, Yes.

12:43
Is that how people use it?

12:46
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:48
Sometimes I I used, I didn't use this kind of tools but I use the posit pass it, Yeah.

12:59
In a particular project, I need to run a brainstorming session and I use this kind of of platforms, you know, post it.

13:16
Yeah.

13:20
And do you Oh, okay.

13:24
And do you pay for that?

13:26
Do you pay for that on a continuous basis or just per project then?

13:31
in my case it's occasional, I do not use this always, but some of my colleagues have continues, you say subscription per year or or something?

13:48
It depends on the kind of company, my my strength, my focuses on the analysis, not on the client management, you know, this creativity, working with the client, I participate in this kind of session, but I do not deliver these kind of situations.

14:09
Got it.

14:11
Okay, So okay, so I think the other the other sort of the other kind of insight, I think we feel like we sort of found is sort of around how people think about.

14:39
So our like our like framework for how we're approaching this is we're trying to think of ways in which we could make a tenfold improvement to somebody's working process.

14:52
And Alex I don't even have the photo of the white board from the other day is on slack.

14:59
I think you took a picture of it.

15:03
let me check otherwise, I might have it.

15:08
Maybe let me see.

15:10
Sorry, we did some brainstorming yesterday.

15:11
I got we do a kind of graph that might help.

15:15
I don't have that, don't worry about it, I'll just I can just kind of throw it again.

15:22
so you can still see that tell me what you think of this.

15:33
Like our impression is basically that You know if you imagine like you have a sort of graph of of like you know the time somebody spends on a project And then like the you know the quality they, you know they sort of put out in terms of their work.

16:07
There's like a that's kind of like a minimum There's a sort of minimum amount of quality And the way people work at the moment is sort of like, you know, it's kind of like this And you know, I think where where we're sort of thinking we might be able to add value is by helping people kind of get to get to that same level of quality but in less time, if that makes sense?

16:49
This is fantastic.

16:51
The industry is searching for these kind of all the time.

16:55
Yeah.

16:55
And and I think it's interesting because we had a lot of pushback from people About sort of like doing things 10 times faster or saving time on it.

17:08
But I think I think what they think what they don't want to do is like kind of end up here where it's like faster but it's worse.

17:20
So do you think it's I mean what's your interpretation that do you think it's, would you say that it's accurate to kind of assume that like people are not opposed not opposed to reducing the amount of time they spend on something but they're just their concern is probably related to like the quality that they think they might be able to achieve.

17:41
You know, the reduction in quality that they've seen would happen by doing that.

17:46
Yeah, yeah.

17:51
Yeah.

17:51
The problem for me is credibility.

17:56
It's I need to provide you know, I can give you my experience you see in google translate and understand that it's a similar product.

18:07
I if I when I started to work with google translate some six or seven years ago it was where the the the the arrow stops the first the first centimeter has only very, very short one.

18:28
No, down here.

18:32
Yeah, the whole document but worst, completely worse this is.

18:38
But right now I am using people and deeper provides me good quality translations, very good quality translation and I can obtain and that kind of thing.

18:59
Good quality translation faster.

19:02
So the arrow arrives to the quality level almost the quality level.

19:08
Do you still have to go through it?

19:10
So is it is it kind of like is it like here or is it like here?

19:14
Like here?

19:15
Okay.

19:16
Yeah.

19:17
Because I need to check, I need to check, I only believe in what I read or what I supervised, you know, so good is being there.

19:33
It's fantastic.

19:36
But people is an instrument that has experienced very powerful search changing and you know it's fantastic.

19:47
I am really surprised you know I started to work with it checking every translation and now I do not check every everything because I believe I need to make updates so changes or you know revisions but I trust the truth.

20:08
That's really interesting.

20:09
I think that's a really good example actually of something that like kind of started yeah, started down here and and ended up here.

20:21
Yeah, imagine that what I have, sorry, I need to tell you something.

20:25
I was talking to a colleague I tried to invite to participate in this project but he gave up.

20:32
But the the point is when when we use translator, a person, an expert in translation, we need to wait for two days for receiving the document.

20:51
We need to book the translator for this B B out of time.

20:58
You know this is well next week I will have a good big translation.

21:05
So we need to wait three days, four days.

21:08
I am busy there is not a huge offer.

21:13
and it's very expensive, it is very expensive their service because there's a very qualified person that must express very properly in english and in spanish.

21:29
So you are asking for for review.

21:36
Right?

21:37
So this is like you know these are kind of I guess if you were to like draw it out, this is sort of where we end up it's like Yeah, but when you have deeper deeper I put the document and in 20 seconds I have the document completely translated in a very proper way I need to supervise.

21:58
But I need this is oh fantastic, fantastic.

22:05
Right okay and then this is this makes sense.

22:08
So this is like and then this is like two days sorry that's not super clear.

22:16
Okay so if I ask junior in my team to check all the goals even about Mcdonald's this will take two days, three days depending on the field work for big big samples qualitative big samples.

22:41
I mean more than six groups.

22:43
This is incredibly useful for small samples, pair of interviews in depth interviews for a couple of groups.

22:54
This is doesn't work because you remember all the quotes you were at the groups and you don't need this this kind of tourist sophisticated and allows you to manage huge amounts of information.

23:11
Now this I write my report thinking in what I have in mind you know I check the quotations, I check the transcripts but it's very rapid.

23:28
I can prepare a report on one day.

23:31
I don't need to make this kind of precise quantum analysis or you know how long does it take you to?

23:44
So how long does it take you to analyze something and just doing it by yourself And I guess like how often is that the case as well like how let me let me let me refine my question like, how yeah, how, how often is it that your work just from memory, I guess from like having conducted the call yourself and and do the analysis versus have to sit down and go through it in a bit more detail.

24:20
Yeah, depends on the project.

24:22
Sometimes it takes it's very valuable, very valuable.

24:28
But in two groups or foreign in depth interviews, that is a very, very, very, very small sample.

24:37
It may take two days a proper report, not a top line report that it's sometimes it's the case.

24:47
They asked me just a quick notes on what you heard of, what you see on the spanish respondents of french respondents.

24:56
So I say, okay, so I write down and put my observation see very rapidly in Half the half of the day.

25:09
I have the output already prepared and I sent it to the client.

25:14
But normally the, if the average project is 2-4 groups or something, tend to to have interviews.

25:31
it should take one week for example, average to do the analysis.

25:38
Yeah, more or less.

25:40
I'm not the fastest of the industry.

25:43
Right.

25:44
It sounds like you're very thorough though.

25:48
Yeah.

25:52
Hmm.

25:58
Okay.

26:06
how do you know when you're done with your analysis?

26:08
Like what kind of marks the end of that process for you?

26:13
Like how do you know, how do you know when you've hit this point effectively?

26:26
It's an emotional feeling, you know, has has to to Dimensions one is the questions of the client.

26:38
I have a list of clients request for information.

26:44
There is I need to answer product quality price estimate and you know I don't know a list of questions.

26:56
I have 10 questions that I need to answer in my report.

27:01
I check if these questions are answered.

27:05
Is this that I checked?

27:08
This is not necessary quantitative you know.

27:14
But I check and there is other because I provide inspiration.

27:20
So I need to give an emotional motivation to the client.

27:32
How can I explain these?

27:33
You know, I am providing something new, valuable that changes the up of of the reality.

27:46
So when when I I can't I can't tell the client something innovative and relevant of the understanding of the category of the brand etcetera.

27:58
Is this is the the other element all question answers and powerful ideas, imaginative, innovative approaches to the market.

28:10
And I obtained this because I go very deep in the first part.

28:15
Not every researcher does this way.

28:21
Mhm.

28:25
Right, okay.

28:33
It's like it kind of sounds like it's when you feel like you've provided them with like a actionable, an actionable response.

28:51
Yeah, yeah.

28:55
The final question.

28:57
The client has a final question.

28:58
Normally, usually they want to know something in particular that has some dimensions or layers of solutions, you know the product, the price, the quality, the market etcetera.

29:16
But the clients, the clients want to know.

29:19
Can I trust this idea?

29:21
Can I follow this idea?

29:24
It's okay for me for my grand if I do this This is the moment I am giving solid solution is when I when I can say that.

29:45
Okay, what does what does bad qualitative research look like?

29:53
But qualitative research is something huh.

29:59
Mhm.

30:01
First of all, they do not answer the client's question.

30:06
Second, they are drowned by data.

30:11
They explained a lot of data data data about what's behind the data.

30:19
A lot of information.

30:21
Lots of information.

30:22
This is one of the scenes of market research.

30:28
You do not find the the idea.

30:32
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:38
And consistent documents, documents that do not follow the explanation like gold.

30:49
Yeah, they go without step by step.

30:55
You know, something sometimes that's not, I can explain.

31:01
You should have a linear approach or some people use the you know, like, I don't know if you're Yeah, the classic like Mackenzie thing.

31:17
Yeah, you should follow kind of these instruments that allows the explanation you are giving to be consistent, solid and powerful.

31:29
Change the client's mind.

31:31
So you need to click cover each of these dimensions.

31:36
Sometimes qualitative researcher.

31:41
No are not able to do that.

31:44
I see reports that are very very weak, very weak in this sense.

31:50
You know, they do not give me you need to be holistic.

31:55
I mean you need to cover all the dimensions that are relevant in certain market and you forgot what, so you did not cover an aspect that is extremely relevant.

32:26
Okay.

32:29
Got it.

32:30
So I would say, oh thinking process at the moment is like, you know, I thought process right now is that it seems like there's interest in speeding up analysis within the constraint of sufficient quality.

32:48
And we're trying to think of, I don't know, we're trying to we're trying to think about what the solution to that actually looks like.

32:55
So we built the we built this like chat but you know, we tried that out and I guess like I don't know one thing that might be helpful and unless and you know, I invite you to, you know anything as well, if you think it'll be useful for us to know.

33:08
Like when you talk about getting an analyst to help out with going through all of this data, what do you get them to do?

33:22
I didn't understand what you mean.

33:25
If you do a typical project and you end up doing 2-4 groups, 10, 12 interviews.

33:33
and you you get like an analyst to help check over the to work with you or to help you out like what what would you what would you get them to do?

33:48
what I do is to if you had someone helping you like a like an assistant like let's say yeah you know like a grad and internal something.

33:57
Who's just like a spare pair of pants.

33:59
Yeah do this do this sometimes depending on the amount of information I need to manage.

34:06
I call junior supporters finalist.

34:11
So I give them the transcripts, the transcripts or the pictures that have been taken by the respondent.

34:20
You know sometimes different types of information sources.

34:28
So I asked them and find I give them a briefing asking what what is the what are we exploring?

34:41
What is the category?

34:42
What is the objective of the project?

34:44
They need to think by themselves.

34:46
That is very important.

34:48
I believe what the people find that is the difficult task because some junior analysts do not understand what are you, what they are searching because they are not familiar with client requests.

35:09
So this is a tough activity.

35:13
So you need to put a lot of attention briefing them.

35:17
I what I expect is they do the selection of the themes for areas to cover.

35:30
And quotations that are useful to explain what they mean.

35:36
I I expect they give me my God, yeah a selection of yeah pictures or debating or something that gives credibility to the affirmation of the statements they are writing.

36:01
You know this is and they give me, well sometimes they give me frequencies of usage of certain words or kind of connection.

36:13
They they find that appear in the data.

36:18
You know Mcdonald's is always associated with burgers by.

36:24
Okay.

36:25
It's not associated with coffee.

36:27
Okay.

36:28
That's a learning.

36:30
You know, they can't give me this kind of but I need to put these in a holistic approach, bigger.

36:39
.

36:41
So it's it's either kind of to affirm ideas that you have or to to kind of as a first pass on information to collect themes and construct data and in a sort of holistic way as you said.

36:57
So I'm just trying to understand.

36:59
So the primary like role of an analyst for you is either to do some work at the start.

37:05
So some introductory work to collect data, gather ideas together from the transcripts or it's to kind of come in at the end and as you said provide affirmation for something that you've done.

37:17
So just to check work you've been doing and seeing if there's a similar or different.

37:22
Alright.

37:24
Yeah.

37:24
Yeah.

37:24
Yeah.

37:24
I understand there is two levels.

37:28
Because I give you the transcripts.

37:31
These are the transcript.

37:32
Please read them and tell me what happened in the groups or in the interviews doing field work.

37:41
But what did we find?

37:44
You know is what do we find out?

37:46
The second step is Okay.

37:49
What does this mean to the client, what what do we discover that we didn't know about this market or what did what did we confirm that is happening in the market and we do not have already checked it.

38:06
We didn't have the idea that this was happening.

38:10
So this is the connection there is a work on the data and this is huge managing because the data are every everywhere and you don't know where they are.

38:26
Right?

38:27
Is that the way that people say the frequency, the feeling that they put in the in their expressions?

38:36
And you realize because people laugh because people were laughing, you give more meaning to this idea.

38:48
You know people say you know the discussion between two respondents, they do not agree about a certain dimension.

38:59
You know it's it's not only Mhm.

39:05
Price is very relevant.

39:08
No.

39:09
Is something we are trying to connect because his price is very important because it's a very expensive product and families cannot afford it.

39:24
You know you need to connect with the whole experience of the family of the category.

39:31
This is the first part is analyzing the results.

39:36
And the second part is the connection with the whole world.

39:39
The word of the client.

39:40
The word of the researcher with of the market.

39:44
I don't know.

39:46
Okay Can I.

39:50
Okay so let me so we we thought with our first student product, we did a bunch of interviews a few months ago with the objective of trying to reduce the number of people who are canceling their accounts.

40:12
And what we did is we basically took a selection of them that it's quite rudimentary, basically a selection of them.

40:29
So we looked at people who, we looked at people who are still using it, We looked at people who left and we like trying to figure out what was different about these people compared with these people to understand that.

40:51
And you know you can see we did quite a few interviews.

40:54
There's like 12, how many was it?

40:56
It's 20 for interviews.

41:01
He's like a subset of them.

41:02
If you were if you were like trying to get some analysts to help you with this What sort of briefing would you give them?

41:14
Like how would you explain to them what they're looking out for when they go through all of this this feedback Like I feel like I'm and how complete that is a question you'll probably probably have some refinement that will depend on the actual objectives but like roughly I mean you kind of see what I'm getting at.

41:36
Like how would you explain to us, like if we were if we were helping you out, how would you how how did you brief us on like doing this properly and like you know figuring out what to look for.

41:53
their respondents are answering about what So we we built a product for them a software tool?

42:03
Okay and then they're telling us like we asked them questions like you know how did they find it?

42:11
What do they think of it and why did they leave or what are they, how are they using it right now?

42:16
If they stayed basically Yeah.

42:22
I if I should I brief you about my my approach, I would ask please read the transcripts and search for the motivations which are the concerns people have related to these category, category or this word of which are the problems or they face when they do analysis.

42:54
what's the picture of they have an ideal solution and what are the tools they are using?

43:03
I need to know this in order to if I check product, I need to evaluate which are the groups of evaluation which are the key dimensions that they that they select and the reason for satisfaction or dissatisfaction for giving up the product.

43:29
You know, I I am focused by, we need to know we need to answer the client why the product or the service works or doesn't work be in order to deliver this answer.

43:43
We need to understand the consumer using this, why the consumer finds is very useful and why it is not useful at all in any case.

43:57
So yeah, this is more or less more or less.

44:06
Okay, I need to please give me knowledge to understand why what is relevant for the for the consumer in their job, not related to my product in their job.

44:21
So identify what's significant for him or for her and then we analyze the product.

44:28
Give me the clues of the product perception and then give me solutions, possible solutions to solve the problems that appear in the in the client satisfaction.

44:41
More or less more or less.

44:43
This is I need to think about this.

44:45
I need to write down, you know, interesting.

44:52
It's like I guess so foods kind of break that down a bit.

45:00
It's like your, you know, we like, let's say we were your client or okay let's say I don't know that.

45:08
Yeah.

45:09
Say say this.

45:10
You're working on this.

45:11
The the problem the objective is like how do we get less people to cancel and from that you would derive.

45:19
You'd have done the interviews and then you kind of have a bit of a sense and you'd like come up with some ideas for things to look for in these transcripts and if you were using some support you would get them, you would brief them on that and you'd say I'm trying to figure out why people leave these are the sort of things I want you to look for.

45:38
I'm interested in like people's motivations and understanding what they care about.

45:44
and I, you know, and I want you to go and find examples of that in these transcripts.

45:53
Yeah.

45:56
Got it really interesting.

45:59
Yeah.

46:00
Someone sent me this the other day actually and if you've seen it, it's quite sort of I don't know if you ever seen this before around sort of behavior changes.

46:12
But I guess like if you from like a product point of view then if you were trying to go through transcripts to analyze like why something had or hadn't caused the behavior change, then maybe maybe these are the sorts of categories that you would be looking for.

46:26
Like can you find what triggers people, what motivates them?

46:30
Whether it's easy and do they feel reward?

46:35
Yeah.

46:35
Yeah, Yeah.

46:36
Yeah.

46:37
I don't, I don't know this this looks like, well, very good scheme pattern to analyze.

46:48
But I don't think this is necessarily the case for all the research project.

46:57
But it could be okay.

47:01
I am missing something.

47:05
Oh yeah.

47:06
Oh, sorry.

47:09
yeah.

47:12
It's the current behavior you know.

47:16
Hmm.

47:18
And then the current behavior, what's that pain in their activity.

47:24
But the pain point they are having right now.

47:28
And the motivation.

47:30
You know.

47:31
How can I say that?

47:32
, if if people is because you know this, this example of this scheme, I find it it's okay.

48:03
But it starts to work on something.

48:08
It starts to trying to change what is happening right now.

48:13
And motivation means meaningful meaningfulness.

48:24
This, this is something meaningful for them and it's already is solving something that is really a problem or proposes a solution.

48:40
You know, it gives a new experience.

48:45
You know, you know, sometimes you are buying a product that doesn't solve any problem.

49:00
Current problem that creates a new need you know I I I am thinking in the cameras on mobile phones at the beginning, nobody said that is something interesting.

49:15
The telephone is the mobile phone is something to talk and the when the camera was included, nobody paid attention at the very beginning.

49:26
And now it's very useful you know?

49:29
So this is it's not problem solving this, creating a new reality.

49:37
So better experience or So I don't want to I want to reduce the it's not only problem solving innovation can be at different levels.

49:53
Do you Do you have an example of like, I don't know if you ever type up anything or or like give them give these analysts like a document.

50:02
Do you don't know do you have an example of one of those who might be able to look at or is it more?

50:08
Do you generally just explain it to them?

50:10
Yeah, it's difficult to make them have examples because their documents.

50:19
Okay, that makes sense.

50:22
Got it.

50:25
Alex do you have any other other questions do you want to ask about or?

50:29
No.

50:30
The only the only thing was if you I was wondering if you knew where we might be able to find some qualitative research reports to look at?

50:36
Just because we're interested in kind of evaluating what understanding in more detail, what a final report looks like Do you know if there are any sort of example reports online or I need to, I do not have in mind but I've seen several reports, they need to be in english.

51:02
not necessarily, I mean probably ideal if they were but not necessarily just so we can understand, you know, the key information, how these things are structured.

51:11
We've spoken to a few people but we haven't really seen many reports.

51:15
so we have an idea about it would be really useful just to look through them in more detail.

51:19
Yeah, I will check with banking, my colleagues in Spain, they have the report, you know, some reports are public that are prepared for the local administration, you know, they are already published in the in the, you know, the council city council or website or something.

51:52
So I don't know what I didn't find more difficult is marketing products, marketing reports.

52:05
let me check because I don't know but an old one could be good videos awesome.

52:14
Let me check.

52:21
Pretty good.

52:24
Okay, well my feedback from the spine from Spain about I check this with some colleagues.

52:31
The idea and people do not believe problem is credibility.

52:37
How can they do that?

52:40
And explain your google and deeply are very powerful tools currently for translation and this will happen the same with preparing reports, you know, but people do not, my colleagues that are very experienced senior researchers.

53:01
they do not believe there there is something capable, How can this work, how, which can be the, you know, part of that explains how can I say, my my concern in your situation could be, I don't know, is how can I explain in a very few words that these application is, can provide useful output that will allow me to and more money or reduce my time involved in the projects, you know?

53:46
Yeah, I need to give them, I thought I needed to, well, because of AI technology, but this is not enough.

53:58
I don't know, I don't know.

53:59
You know, the point is, you don't need to know the aspirin, formula to have better healing your brain.

54:14
Your, you know, there is something there, but there is something there you should believe.

54:22
I don't know, I don't know, that's, I think that's really astute.

54:26
I think it's something that we experience with our student product as well.

54:29
Like, people were people had a sort of disbelief around around what we were selling and they were like, surely, surely this doesn't actually work, you know, and I think, I think it's a real, I'd say those are the two, there's the two biggest emotional responses to Ai right now that I've seen, it's like, at least with like language stuff, it's like, does it actually work?

54:54
And can I trust it.

54:55
, and, yeah, I think, I think that's a that's a really interesting bit of feedback from, from speaking to your colleagues.

55:04
Yeah.

55:04
Thank thanks for reaching out to them.

55:09
Okay, well let's see anything else.

55:14
I know this has been extremely helpful and if it's okay, we'd love to stay in touch and kind of keep you updated on progress and yeah, kind of let you know when we've got something a bit more, a bit more robust to test out.

55:27
Yeah.

55:27
You are not already in the market with demos or beta versions?

55:32
No, not, yeah, we'll we'll we'll reach out to you first.

55:36
Then when we get to that point we've we've spoken to about 20 people, they'd say now.

55:40
and yeah, I think you guys have been really sort of influential in the product direction and I'd really love to share with you.

55:48
you know, the product, once we build something.

55:50
Okay, Okay.

55:52
Please let me know.

55:53
I will be very, very interested, interested.

55:56
I am a potential user.

55:58
Wonderful people for analysis.

56:00
Yeah, awesome.

56:04
Alright.

56:04
Have a nice day.

56:05
Gas on.

56:06
Bye bye.
