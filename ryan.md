Ryan: Ready to roll them around town. (00:00:02:12 - 00:00:06:03)

Ryan: Speed. (00:00:06:18 - 00:00:08:19)

Ryan: Oh, man. We get to do this again. (00:00:09:12 - 00:00:12:06)

Ryan: All big six, bigger house, big rips. (00:00:12:09 - 00:00:15:17)

Ryan: 105, take one. (00:00:16:10 - 00:00:18:07)

Ryan: Substitute, make reference. (00:00:18:07 - 00:00:22:12)

Ryan: All week. (00:00:22:23 - 00:00:23:18)

Ryan: All week long. And five and five. (00:00:23:18 - 00:00:25:21)

Ryan: Yeah. What an experience. (00:00:27:02 - 00:00:28:21)

Ryan: All right. (00:00:28:21 - 00:00:29:07)

Ryan: Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, anything on your mind? (00:00:29:07 - 00:00:32:19)

Ryan: You want to roll up the tongue? (00:00:32:20 - 00:00:35:09)

Ryan: Sure. You guys are awesome. (00:00:35:09 - 00:00:37:18)

Ryan: Did not expect that none of this (00:00:38:01 - 00:00:40:09)

Ryan: obviously was expected, but, (00:00:40:20 - 00:00:43:16)

Ryan: like. (00:00:43:16 - 00:00:44:11)

Ryan: Like I sent you in the text yesterday with that cool picture. (00:00:44:11 - 00:00:47:21)

Ryan: You guys all have a brother in Buffalo. (00:00:48:07 - 00:00:50:00)

Ryan: From here on out, no doubt about it. (00:00:50:00 - 00:00:52:17)

Ryan: Enjoyed every moment. (00:00:52:17 - 00:00:54:10)

Ryan: As weird as it has been. (00:00:54:10 - 00:00:56:20)

Ryan: It's been pretty cool. (00:00:56:20 - 00:00:58:10)

Ryan: Which is weird to not have had any homemade buffalo wings in your backyard. (00:00:58:10 - 00:01:03:00)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:01:03:13 - 00:01:05:11)

Ryan: Yeah, that's kind of a. (00:01:05:11 - 00:01:07:03)

Ryan: Oh, I like you can get great wings anywhere. (00:01:07:03 - 00:01:09:11)

Ryan: I don't know why they because buffalo is not really famous for anything. (00:01:09:14 - 00:01:12:09)

Ryan: It certainly isn't our football or hockey team. (00:01:12:09 - 00:01:14:14)

Ryan: They're both horrible. (00:01:14:14 - 00:01:15:11)

Ryan: So, uh, they made the chicken wings kind of notorious. (00:01:15:11 - 00:01:20:12)

Ryan: Yeah, I have. Good. (00:01:20:23 - 00:01:22:10)

Ryan: I eat chicken wings everywhere (00:01:22:10 - 00:01:23:15)

Ryan: I go and everywhere I go on like these are better than they are back home. (00:01:23:15 - 00:01:26:16)

Ryan: So I don't I don't know what it is. (00:01:27:11 - 00:01:29:11)

Ryan: I think it was first created. (00:01:29:13 - 00:01:31:05)

Ryan: Here was where that came from. (00:01:31:05 - 00:01:33:05)

Ryan: Okay. Yeah. I haven't seen a single chicken. (00:01:33:05 - 00:01:35:12)

Ryan: Yeah, all of it. Where we are are currently (00:01:35:17 - 00:01:38:20)

Ryan: at North Tonawanda is where the carousel was invented (00:01:38:20 - 00:01:42:00)

Ryan: right here. (00:01:43:04 - 00:01:44:08)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:01:44:13 - 00:01:45:01)

Ryan: Interesting fact. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (00:01:45:20 - 00:01:48:02)

Ryan: I feel like I'm driving in circles. All the time. (00:01:48:02 - 00:01:50:17)

Ryan: Right. What? What's your. (00:01:50:18 - 00:01:52:18)

Ryan: When you, uh. (00:01:52:18 - 00:01:54:04)

Ryan: You do like that? Definitely like maps. (00:01:54:05 - 00:01:56:18)

Ryan: So none of us like, tape my feet down. (00:01:56:18 - 00:02:00:23)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:02:02:20 - 00:02:03:01)

Ryan: Speaking of space and time, I'm gonna (00:02:03:01 - 00:02:06:06)

Ryan: you talk about the significance of the space behind you. (00:02:06:06 - 00:02:08:07)

Ryan: Yeah, this shop, we. (00:02:09:05 - 00:02:12:05)

Ryan: We put this together over the course of the last couple of years. (00:02:12:05 - 00:02:15:14)

Ryan: The idea was just what we're doing, move the roof cutting portion of our (00:02:15:15 - 00:02:20:22)

Ryan: our framing details inside, (00:02:21:12 - 00:02:24:04)

Ryan: which was great because it got rid of weather, (00:02:24:17 - 00:02:27:09)

Ryan: you know, and more importantly, (00:02:28:05 - 00:02:30:16)

Ryan: we've noticed now is the space that it saves on site (00:02:30:16 - 00:02:34:00)

Ryan: for the rest of the guys (00:02:34:11 - 00:02:35:16)

Ryan: to have their material kind of scattered about and the forklift. (00:02:35:16 - 00:02:39:05)

Ryan: So I'm not complaining. I don't mind it. (00:02:39:05 - 00:02:42:02)

Ryan: It's nice. (00:02:42:05 - 00:02:43:09)

Ryan: You know, the hot days, it's a little cooler. (00:02:43:10 - 00:02:45:15)

Ryan: The middle of winter, it's a little warmer. (00:02:46:02 - 00:02:48:20)

Ryan: So it's been interesting. (00:02:48:20 - 00:02:51:02)

Ryan: It's very different. (00:02:51:07 - 00:02:52:16)

Ryan: It's not typical for the industry. But, (00:02:52:16 - 00:02:54:23)

Ryan: hey, we'll we'll (00:02:56:02 - 00:02:57:09)

Ryan: we'll try anything that's going to make us faster. (00:02:57:09 - 00:03:00:01)

Ryan: That was the thought. (00:03:00:01 - 00:03:01:15)

Ryan: What does, um. (00:03:02:04 - 00:03:03:19)

Ryan: What does a. Typical day look like for you? (00:03:03:19 - 00:03:05:19)

Ryan: Uh, typical day for me. (00:03:06:16 - 00:03:09:18)

Ryan: There's a lot of cutting. (00:03:09:19 - 00:03:11:02)

Ryan: You know, (00:03:11:02 - 00:03:12:01)

Ryan: if I'm calculating, it'll be depending on the size of the job. (00:03:13:02 - 00:03:17:20)

Ryan: I could spend several days sitting at the little drawing (00:03:17:20 - 00:03:21:17)

Ryan: table, crunching numbers, staring at a plain view drawing. (00:03:21:17 - 00:03:25:03)

Ryan: I like music, so it's always pretty loud in here. (00:03:25:18 - 00:03:28:09)

Ryan: I have the radio going, I'll. (00:03:28:09 - 00:03:30:15)

Ryan: I'll listen to my own playlists, kind of travel around. (00:03:30:17 - 00:03:33:14)

Ryan: Music's very important to me (00:03:33:15 - 00:03:36:22)

Ryan: when I'm cutting. (00:03:37:10 - 00:03:38:16)

Ryan: That's kind of self-explanatory. (00:03:38:16 - 00:03:40:08)

Ryan: But it gets messy. (00:03:40:08 - 00:03:41:04)

Ryan: I. I'll come in here. (00:03:41:04 - 00:03:42:23)

Ryan: I usually start around 7 a.m.. (00:03:42:23 - 00:03:45:09)

Ryan: I'll stop around nine 930, have a cup of coffee, a bite to eat. (00:03:45:09 - 00:03:48:23)

Ryan: Lunch is noon and I'll work till 330, 5:00 depending. (00:03:49:13 - 00:03:53:13)

Ryan: And then after the cutting and the calculating, (00:03:54:19 - 00:03:57:10)

Ryan: we trailer the roof right out to the jobsite and I get (00:03:57:20 - 00:04:01:10)

Ryan: to spend a few days with the guys and we put the roof together and (00:04:01:10 - 00:04:04:22)

Ryan: fortunately lately, the last year or so, it's just been right back to the shop. (00:04:06:08 - 00:04:10:20)

Ryan: There's another drawing, here's the roof, (00:04:10:20 - 00:04:13:02)

Ryan: and I'll kind of get my bearings with that. (00:04:13:02 - 00:04:16:20)

Ryan: And then I'll go out to the site and I'll take a guy or two (00:04:16:20 - 00:04:20:07)

Ryan: snap lines on the foundation, get it squared up as we've covered (00:04:20:16 - 00:04:24:12)

Ryan: and transfer the the dimensions over to the plan and start all over again. (00:04:24:14 - 00:04:29:11)

Ryan: Mark up a plan, create a plan view, cut it, build it. (00:04:30:06 - 00:04:33:21)

Ryan: So it's very repetitious for me. (00:04:34:09 - 00:04:36:23)

Ryan: Sometimes I get a little a little break if we get, you know, (00:04:36:23 - 00:04:41:03)

Ryan: if it's not important that I get started on the next one (00:04:42:01 - 00:04:44:17)

Ryan: because I'm so far ahead, I'll fall back and build stairs (00:04:44:17 - 00:04:48:09)

Ryan: or install stairs, you know, pick up work like that on site just to help out. (00:04:48:09 - 00:04:52:20)

Ryan: But like I said, it's been pretty steady, just roofs for quite some time. (00:04:52:20 - 00:04:57:07)

Ryan: We've seen all of the (00:04:59:02 - 00:04:59:22)

Ryan: thought and the math that's involved with what you do throughout the week. (00:04:59:22 - 00:05:03:00)

Ryan: And I'm curious how like (00:05:03:05 - 00:05:06:08)

Ryan: what you know, what are you thinking about? (00:05:06:08 - 00:05:09:00)

Ryan: You want to wake up one day to clear this. (00:05:09:05 - 00:05:12:22)

Ryan: Morning's early morning person here? (00:05:12:23 - 00:05:16:13)

Ryan: Most of my hobbies are early morning things as well. (00:05:16:13 - 00:05:20:07)

Ryan: Fishing, hunting. Done that my whole life. (00:05:20:07 - 00:05:22:15)

Ryan: So I'm up early every day, 5:00, you know, quarter to five. (00:05:22:15 - 00:05:26:18)

Ryan: Have my coffee. (00:05:27:11 - 00:05:29:08)

Ryan: That's the thing with this. (00:05:29:08 - 00:05:31:00)

Ryan: It can be very demanding for me because I get so into it (00:05:31:00 - 00:05:34:21)

Ryan: that it's constantly on my mind. (00:05:34:21 - 00:05:37:21)

Ryan: You know, when I'm driving to work, I'm noticing the rooflines and you know, (00:05:38:05 - 00:05:42:08)

Ryan: a lot of times it's the same roofs I've looked at hundreds of times, (00:05:43:01 - 00:05:46:00)

Ryan: but I'll still find something I missed or appreciate, something I didn't notice. (00:05:46:00 - 00:05:51:17)

Ryan: So mornings I try to stay focused. (00:05:52:10 - 00:05:55:04)

Ryan: All day I turn my phone off, I check it frequently. (00:05:55:04 - 00:05:58:22)

Ryan: Case it's, you know, a job site issue but distractions (00:05:58:23 - 00:06:02:17)

Ryan: will trip me up and then I'll make mistakes. (00:06:03:16 - 00:06:06:02)

Ryan: And my mistakes are huge. (00:06:06:02 - 00:06:08:01)

Ryan: So I try to keep them to a minimum, but. (00:06:08:01 - 00:06:10:06)

Ryan: And then at night I lay in bed and think about roof framing (00:06:11:02 - 00:06:15:01)

Ryan: literally. (00:06:16:14 - 00:06:17:20)

Ryan: So I think I actually with that being said, (00:06:18:14 - 00:06:21:01)

Ryan: a lot of my techniques and approach, I maybe learned subconsciously (00:06:21:01 - 00:06:26:03)

Ryan: because it's always on my mind. (00:06:26:03 - 00:06:28:10)

Ryan: And then when I get to work, I kind of apply some ideas or thoughts (00:06:28:10 - 00:06:33:08)

Ryan: that I've had. (00:06:33:08 - 00:06:34:10)

Ryan: So it's been a long thing to evolve to what it is now for. (00:06:34:10 - 00:06:39:03)

Ryan: I'm sorry. Just what you're. (00:06:39:08 - 00:06:40:23)

Ryan: You're. (00:06:40:23 - 00:06:41:05)

Ryan: You're sorry, Alfie. (00:06:41:13 - 00:06:46:04)

Ryan: Okay, so where did it start for you? (00:06:46:04 - 00:06:48:15)

Ryan: Framing in general or the roof? (00:06:50:00 - 00:06:52:01)

Ryan: How did. (00:06:52:08 - 00:06:52:17)

Ryan: How did all of this creep into your mind so pervasively? (00:06:52:17 - 00:06:55:10)

Ryan: So we would go back to well, (00:06:56:02 - 00:07:00:01)

Ryan: as as a younger child, I'd say teens. (00:07:00:01 - 00:07:04:09)

Ryan: My neighbor that lived across the street in the town (00:07:04:23 - 00:07:07:20)

Ryan: I grew up in, his father was a contractor. (00:07:07:20 - 00:07:10:20)

Ryan: So my friend and I would always be helping him, (00:07:11:21 - 00:07:14:22)

Ryan: you know, weekends, evenings (00:07:15:07 - 00:07:18:00)

Ryan: through high school and even middle school (00:07:18:20 - 00:07:21:01)

Ryan: on the job, just, you know, cleaning up, doing things like that, stacking lumber. (00:07:21:01 - 00:07:24:12)

Ryan: So I was I was around it. (00:07:24:12 - 00:07:26:18)

Ryan: I've always had (00:07:26:18 - 00:07:29:04)

Ryan: an interest in building things (00:07:29:13 - 00:07:32:05)

Ryan: since I was far as I can remember. (00:07:32:05 - 00:07:34:18)

Ryan: Like Christmas would come every year and I would ask for plastic (00:07:35:10 - 00:07:39:00)

Ryan: airplane models, testers, models, and I would build them. (00:07:39:00 - 00:07:42:10)

Ryan: But, you know, dozens at a time. (00:07:42:10 - 00:07:43:23)

Ryan: I had them hanging all over the ceiling in my bedroom. (00:07:43:23 - 00:07:47:02)

Ryan: Aviation's always been huge. (00:07:48:05 - 00:07:50:07)

Ryan: So that that turned into pillows if you've ever heard that's a company. (00:07:50:07 - 00:07:55:12)

Ryan: But the rubber band powered (00:07:55:12 - 00:07:56:20)

Ryan: where it's all stick framed and then you put tissue paper (00:07:56:20 - 00:07:59:13)

Ryan: and used soap to stick the tissue and then water decals. (00:07:59:13 - 00:08:03:14)

Ryan: And then that evolved into radio control airplanes. (00:08:03:14 - 00:08:07:01)

Ryan: And I was building and flying those. (00:08:07:01 - 00:08:09:13)

Ryan: So building has always been there. (00:08:09:13 - 00:08:12:19)

Ryan: So I graduated high school, I work that summer. (00:08:12:19 - 00:08:17:02)

Ryan: Oh, also (00:08:17:10 - 00:08:18:08)

Ryan: my father remodeled the house that I grew up in (00:08:19:08 - 00:08:21:21)

Ryan: and he paid the contractor he hired to employ me for a summer. (00:08:21:21 - 00:08:27:06)

Ryan: So it was that was my first taste that, (00:08:27:06 - 00:08:30:01)

Ryan: you know, a decent little paycheck every week. (00:08:30:11 - 00:08:33:17)

Ryan: You know, I had had I had other jobs delivering pizza and things like that. (00:08:34:06 - 00:08:37:10)

Ryan: But working on our own home that I had grown up in, (00:08:37:10 - 00:08:41:06)

Ryan: maybe kind of drove the nail home to get to see (00:08:42:05 - 00:08:45:17)

Ryan: what was behind all the walls that I was so used to for so many years. (00:08:45:17 - 00:08:49:09)

Ryan: And then to bring it all back together and make it new. (00:08:49:09 - 00:08:53:00)

Ryan: I then (00:08:54:07 - 00:08:55:10)

Ryan: I went to college. (00:08:56:01 - 00:08:57:17)

Ryan: I did a year and a half, almost two years again the whole time (00:08:57:17 - 00:09:02:04)

Ryan: during breaks, winter breaks all summer. (00:09:02:14 - 00:09:05:08)

Ryan: I'd take pick up work working on a framing crew (00:09:06:00 - 00:09:09:05)

Ryan: and eventually I went full time, (00:09:10:04 - 00:09:12:15)

Ryan: some sometime around 99, 2000. And (00:09:13:04 - 00:09:16:23)

Ryan: my love for it just kind of took off. (00:09:17:23 - 00:09:20:04)

Ryan: There was everything the smells, the sounds, the crew working together. (00:09:20:04 - 00:09:24:11)

Ryan: There wasn't anything about it that I didn't enjoy. (00:09:25:02 - 00:09:27:12)

Ryan: I mean, the weather, but that just goes with it like anything. (00:09:27:12 - 00:09:31:02)

Ryan: And fast forward, I met my wife (00:09:32:09 - 00:09:35:09)

Ryan: in college there and she graduated. (00:09:35:17 - 00:09:39:05)

Ryan: She's a couple of years older than I. (00:09:39:05 - 00:09:41:16)

Ryan: She moved out here to western New York. (00:09:41:16 - 00:09:43:22)

Ryan: I stuck around back home in Oswego for six months (00:09:44:18 - 00:09:48:23)

Ryan: and I followed her out. (00:09:50:01 - 00:09:51:21)

Ryan: Then I got out here and I looked for a job. (00:09:51:21 - 00:09:54:08)

Ryan: There was hundreds of ads in the newspapers and I called every phone (00:09:55:03 - 00:09:58:23)

Ryan: number and I didn't hear anything for like two weeks. (00:09:58:23 - 00:10:02:18)

Ryan: So I had a little bit of money. (00:10:03:03 - 00:10:04:22)

Ryan: We had an apartment. (00:10:04:22 - 00:10:06:15)

Ryan: I didn't know anybody. (00:10:06:15 - 00:10:07:15)

Ryan: I had no friends, no family, so to speak of. (00:10:07:15 - 00:10:10:05)

Ryan: Sorry. Right. (00:10:10:11 - 00:10:11:14)

Ryan: Getting some kind of sound coming out of this. (00:10:11:17 - 00:10:14:06)

Ryan: I had (00:10:14:06 - 00:10:14:16)

Ryan: our boats commuted (00:10:17:00 - 00:10:18:15)

Ryan: over here in New (00:10:19:16 - 00:10:22:11)

Ryan: to turn up the volume. (00:10:43:14 - 00:10:45:18)

Ryan: Yeah. Oh, do we have. (00:10:45:18 - 00:10:47:21)

Ryan: There's only one way to (00:10:47:21 - 00:10:49:06)

Ryan: run into that. (00:10:52:09 - 00:10:53:11)

Ryan: You know, that's you get real (00:10:53:15 - 00:10:55:22)

Ryan: life on your left in the room today. (00:10:55:22 - 00:11:00:21)

Ryan: Oh you do it on that. (00:11:01:07 - 00:11:03:02)

Ryan: I would do it. (00:11:03:06 - 00:11:03:18)

Ryan: Oh but so when you mute. (00:11:03:18 - 00:11:06:13)

Ryan: Mute, this is just your mic. (00:11:06:13 - 00:11:08:15)

Ryan: So that's if we're hearing him, (00:11:08:15 - 00:11:11:12)

Ryan: you know, I think it was me too, you know? (00:11:11:12 - 00:11:17:03)

Ryan: I don't know. We should be good enough (00:11:17:03 - 00:11:19:22)

Ryan: was enough for (00:11:20:18 - 00:11:22:05)

Ryan: it's been good up until this moment I'm getting so. (00:11:22:05 - 00:11:25:16)

Ryan: Thank you. (00:11:25:16 - 00:11:27:00)

Ryan: You didn't take anything up until then? (00:11:27:06 - 00:11:29:13)

Ryan: Yeah, it just started to feel (00:11:29:13 - 00:11:31:17)

Ryan: sort of up, I guess. (00:11:33:06 - 00:11:36:06)

Ryan: Okay, so you followed your favorite person out? (00:11:36:06 - 00:11:38:21)

Ryan: Yeah. So (00:11:39:01 - 00:11:39:23)

Ryan: I ended up out here (00:11:40:23 - 00:11:42:14)

Ryan: western New York and couldn't find a job as a carpenter for a couple of weeks. (00:11:42:14 - 00:11:47:18)

Ryan: And then all of a sudden, one day, (00:11:47:18 - 00:11:49:15)

Ryan: you know, my cell phone and this is when cell phones were humongous, right? (00:11:49:15 - 00:11:53:00)

Ryan: We're going back. (00:11:53:10 - 00:11:54:22)

Ryan: I got a whole lot of voicemails and not knowing any better. (00:11:55:01 - 00:11:59:00)

Ryan: I, I took the first guy his offer. (00:11:59:00 - 00:12:02:07)

Ryan: They called me back and he worked (00:12:02:07 - 00:12:04:18)

Ryan: in the south towns was it's what we call it here. (00:12:05:09 - 00:12:09:04)

Ryan: But I had no idea what that meant. (00:12:09:04 - 00:12:10:16)

Ryan: So he asked me, you know, where are you coming from? (00:12:10:16 - 00:12:12:23)

Ryan: And I told him and he said, Well, that's like a 40, 45 minute ride every day. (00:12:12:23 - 00:12:17:03)

Ryan: And at that point, I was just so happy to have found some work (00:12:17:03 - 00:12:20:22)

Ryan: that I did that for almost two years. And (00:12:21:11 - 00:12:25:03)

Ryan: I had an older pickup truck (00:12:26:11 - 00:12:28:18)

Ryan: and it started to, you know, have ailments and fuel lines. (00:12:28:18 - 00:12:32:04)

Ryan: I'd fill up my tank on the way to work (00:12:32:04 - 00:12:33:19)

Ryan: and the truck would sit there all day and I'd get in and it would be empty. (00:12:33:19 - 00:12:36:23)

Ryan: I just I couldn't afford to keep doing that. So I (00:12:36:23 - 00:12:40:10)

Ryan: over the course of those couple of years, I had met some other people (00:12:42:08 - 00:12:46:03)

Ryan: and had started, you know, creating racial friendships and relationships. (00:12:46:03 - 00:12:50:16)

Ryan: And one of my brother in law's (00:12:50:16 - 00:12:53:21)

Ryan: best friends worked for a pretty large (00:12:53:21 - 00:12:57:08)

Ryan: commercial construction outfit, and he got me in there. (00:12:57:08 - 00:13:01:05)

Ryan: So I did commercial carpentry for several years, which was great. (00:13:01:05 - 00:13:05:12)

Ryan: I had never been exposed to (00:13:06:07 - 00:13:08:18)

Ryan: drywall and metal stud framing and grid ceilings, and I loved it. (00:13:08:18 - 00:13:12:18)

Ryan: I did that for a few years. (00:13:12:18 - 00:13:15:05)

Ryan: And then him and I, he and I, that same guy became friends (00:13:15:05 - 00:13:19:16)

Ryan: and we started our own business, went back to doing residential stuff. (00:13:19:16 - 00:13:24:19)

Ryan: We did a lot of framing, kind of everything. (00:13:24:19 - 00:13:27:00)

Ryan: I've been lucky with that. (00:13:27:00 - 00:13:28:07)

Ryan: I've, I've done a lot. (00:13:28:07 - 00:13:31:00)

Ryan: It hasn't always been framing, (00:13:31:01 - 00:13:33:01)

Ryan: but framing has been always kind of where my heart was. (00:13:33:01 - 00:13:36:11)

Ryan: I'd get away from it for a little while and I would always come back. (00:13:37:05 - 00:13:39:19)

Ryan: I just I missed. (00:13:40:03 - 00:13:41:00)

Ryan: It was like an old friend. (00:13:41:00 - 00:13:44:02)

Ryan: So I hopped crews here and there, you know, it didn't work out with him (00:13:44:02 - 00:13:47:21)

Ryan: and I, which is fine. (00:13:47:21 - 00:13:49:00)

Ryan: We're still great friends. (00:13:49:00 - 00:13:50:03)

Ryan: I love the guy. (00:13:50:03 - 00:13:53:00)

Ryan: Tried my own hand at running a framing crew, which was amazing. (00:13:53:00 - 00:13:56:11)

Ryan: We were very successful, kind of hit a lull in the work around here. (00:13:56:11 - 00:14:00:14)

Ryan: We had sort of a decline in the industry and a recession (00:14:00:14 - 00:14:04:05)

Ryan: and found a (00:14:05:17 - 00:14:06:11)

Ryan: great company guy I'd been friends with for many years (00:14:06:11 - 00:14:09:17)

Ryan: and we just kind of built up what we've got going on now. (00:14:09:17 - 00:14:14:08)

Ryan: And the the roof cutting was always there and we were always that. (00:14:14:08 - 00:14:19:09)

Ryan: It always gripped me even back before I had moved out here. (00:14:19:09 - 00:14:24:05)

Ryan: I always would look at the older guy out in the front cut (00:14:24:05 - 00:14:27:04)

Ryan: in the rafters, and I just I admired it. (00:14:27:06 - 00:14:30:03)

Ryan: How could he (00:14:30:07 - 00:14:32:00)

Ryan: obtain all of these cuts and measurements? (00:14:32:04 - 00:14:34:06)

Ryan: And then everything just goes together so perfectly? (00:14:34:06 - 00:14:36:13)

Ryan: And it you know, I think no doubt that's every frame and Carpenter's favorite part, (00:14:36:13 - 00:14:40:20)

Ryan: because it's different on on every house walls or walls and floors or floors. (00:14:40:20 - 00:14:45:13)

Ryan: I mean, there's, you know, subtle differences, but the roof is its unique. (00:14:46:03 - 00:14:51:18)

Ryan: So I just I worked on it. (00:14:51:18 - 00:14:53:13)

Ryan: It interests me and I would take that interest home (00:14:53:13 - 00:14:57:03)

Ryan: with me or I'd stay late and we would run string lines (00:14:57:03 - 00:15:01:05)

Ryan: to figure our hip angles and try to calculate our cuts that way. (00:15:01:05 - 00:15:06:06)

Ryan: And I would record all of that in a little book that I kept (00:15:06:06 - 00:15:09:14)

Ryan: in my truck. (00:15:09:21 - 00:15:12:23)

Ryan: I'd build little models, I'd try things, I'd stay after work (00:15:12:23 - 00:15:16:06)

Ryan: when something wasn't quite right and I knew it was off a little bit. (00:15:16:06 - 00:15:19:02)

Ryan: I would stay and try to teach myself, you know, what could I have done differently? (00:15:19:02 - 00:15:24:19)

Ryan: Or What am I missing? (00:15:24:19 - 00:15:26:00)

Ryan: Why is this off? (00:15:26:00 - 00:15:27:12)

Ryan: Why are my, my and my bevels a little off? (00:15:27:12 - 00:15:30:14)

Ryan: You know, why did I come up a little short? (00:15:30:14 - 00:15:32:14)

Ryan: And that's when I first started drawing in plan view. (00:15:33:08 - 00:15:37:09)

Ryan: You know, I thought, why can't I look at this (00:15:38:06 - 00:15:40:22)

Ryan: from above and see what's taking place? (00:15:40:22 - 00:15:43:22)

Ryan: And then the more and more I practice and I created (00:15:43:22 - 00:15:46:08)

Ryan: dozens of those completely wrong. (00:15:47:03 - 00:15:49:08)

Ryan: It was all about the rise. (00:15:49:13 - 00:15:53:08)

Ryan: I'm not sure where I first maybe got that idea, but (00:15:53:08 - 00:15:58:09)

Ryan: there isn't a lot of information on it. (00:15:59:08 - 00:16:01:04)

Ryan: You can find it, (00:16:01:04 - 00:16:03:02)

Ryan: but it's (00:16:03:06 - 00:16:04:13)

Ryan: it's not very elaborate (00:16:06:01 - 00:16:08:00)

Ryan: to the extent that we've taken it here. (00:16:08:00 - 00:16:10:15)

Ryan: So I've kind of turned it into (00:16:11:20 - 00:16:14:06)

Ryan: my method. It's (00:16:14:06 - 00:16:16:18)

Ryan: I can do it without that now (00:16:16:19 - 00:16:18:12)

Ryan: using the angles and having the know how. (00:16:18:12 - 00:16:21:08)

Ryan: But that took me many years to realize I don't really necessarily (00:16:21:23 - 00:16:27:07)

Ryan: need the plan view, but it's always there and I'm still I still use it. (00:16:27:07 - 00:16:30:21)

Ryan: I shouldn't say I don't because I do. (00:16:30:21 - 00:16:32:16)

Ryan: That's the most important part of the technique that I'm applying. (00:16:32:16 - 00:16:37:08)

Ryan: But as I've mentioned in our courses, (00:16:38:08 - 00:16:41:01)

Ryan: the more you use those, the more you start to see (00:16:41:06 - 00:16:44:02)

Ryan: different scenarios and the roof (00:16:45:13 - 00:16:48:18)

Ryan: kind of comes to life right in front of you on a piece of plywood. So (00:16:48:18 - 00:16:52:14)

Ryan: yeah, it's just been a long, (00:16:53:15 - 00:16:56:00)

Ryan: passionate journey (00:16:56:05 - 00:16:58:12)

Ryan: and I feel lucky for it. (00:16:58:16 - 00:17:00:09)

Ryan: That's the other thing (00:17:00:09 - 00:17:02:03)

Ryan: I may not have ever felt this way. (00:17:03:02 - 00:17:05:12)

Ryan: Had the area that I live in and work in, (00:17:06:08 - 00:17:08:19)

Ryan: didn't have such great architecture and these great roofs. (00:17:09:10 - 00:17:12:03)

Ryan: So that was kind of out of necessity (00:17:12:03 - 00:17:14:19)

Ryan: and it always intrigued me, so I just kind of followed it on my own. (00:17:15:05 - 00:17:18:13)

Ryan: So this has been great to get to share that with fellow carpenters. (00:17:19:10 - 00:17:24:01)

Ryan: So yeah, wild. (00:17:24:07 - 00:17:26:23)

Ryan: 1/2, guys. (00:17:26:23 - 00:17:28:17)

Ryan: So, Alan, you have headphones. (00:17:29:03 - 00:17:30:04)

Ryan: Yeah, well, I think (00:17:30:04 - 00:17:32:22)

Ryan: so. Hearing something, it's. (00:17:35:16 - 00:17:37:02)

Ryan: So, so subtle. (00:17:37:02 - 00:17:39:13)

Ryan: Like a like a vibration. (00:17:39:13 - 00:17:41:09)

Ryan: No, no, it's a echo of a speaker. (00:17:41:09 - 00:17:43:12)

Ryan: Despite the things are both know (00:17:44:14 - 00:17:57:06)

Ryan: you going to talk for a second? (00:18:00:20 - 00:18:02:04)

Ryan: Yeah. Alan, are you happy? (00:18:02:04 - 00:18:04:19)

Ryan: Miserable. Oh. Oh, yeah. (00:18:04:19 - 00:18:07:03)

Ryan: Yeah. Is it my mike? (00:18:07:03 - 00:18:09:00)

Ryan: No, no, it's all of the sounds that. (00:18:09:00 - 00:18:10:19)

Ryan: Okay, it's just like, (00:18:10:19 - 00:18:12:08)

Ryan: oh, it should be. (00:18:13:13 - 00:18:15:15)

Ryan: Yeah, I don't hear anything of it. (00:18:15:20 - 00:18:18:03)

Ryan: I actually can't hear what you guys are hearing (00:18:18:16 - 00:18:21:09)

Ryan: me either. (00:18:21:09 - 00:18:22:09)

Ryan: I just thought it might have been just coming from the iPod (00:18:22:19 - 00:18:24:17)

Ryan: and we just put a cable in it. (00:18:24:17 - 00:18:25:16)

Ryan: So see, further to the track. (00:18:25:16 - 00:18:28:01)

Ryan: Is it scrubber bill? Was that the term. (00:18:28:13 - 00:18:31:04)

Ryan: Yeah, it is. (00:18:31:17 - 00:18:35:18)

Ryan: All right. (00:18:35:18 - 00:18:36:00)

Ryan: Also, thank you. (00:18:36:00 - 00:18:44:06)

Ryan: Everybody settle and we'll see. (00:18:44:06 - 00:18:48:03)

Ryan: What was it about framing and like kept you going back? (00:18:48:03 - 00:18:50:23)

Ryan: Going back, going back. Sound like that? (00:18:50:23 - 00:18:54:01)

Ryan: What do you think it was about you and framing you know what drew would re (00:18:54:01 - 00:18:57:14)

Ryan: what what keeps drawing you to and what drew you to it? (00:18:57:16 - 00:19:00:07)

Ryan: You know, I've always kind of wondered and asked myself that same thing, (00:19:01:07 - 00:19:05:13)

Ryan: like whether you believe in destiny or any of that. (00:19:05:17 - 00:19:09:05)

Ryan: I just something about assembling things has always just been (00:19:09:05 - 00:19:14:08)

Ryan: even now (00:19:15:22 - 00:19:17:18)

Ryan: I'm a father of three and my oldest son. (00:19:17:18 - 00:19:21:15)

Ryan: We're always like, we've got a motor apart, (00:19:21:22 - 00:19:24:17)

Ryan: you know, we're working on a dirt bike. (00:19:24:17 - 00:19:26:06)

Ryan: We're doing this or that. (00:19:26:06 - 00:19:27:21)

Ryan: So it's it's always been interesting to me to watch something (00:19:27:21 - 00:19:32:23)

Ryan: take shape from efforts (00:19:33:00 - 00:19:35:12)

Ryan: from myself or my colleagues. (00:19:36:06 - 00:19:38:11)

Ryan: A lot of that with the framing (00:19:40:05 - 00:19:42:02)

Ryan: and is the way it feels when (00:19:42:02 - 00:19:46:01)

Ryan: you get in your truck in the morning, you have your cup of coffee, (00:19:47:15 - 00:19:51:01)

Ryan: you got your tool belt in the back, you're driving to work, (00:19:51:01 - 00:19:53:13)

Ryan: listening to the radio. (00:19:54:17 - 00:19:55:18)

Ryan: You're thinking about the day you're planning, (00:19:55:18 - 00:19:57:21)

Ryan: kind of how it's going to go. (00:19:59:19 - 00:20:01:17)

Ryan: And then you arrive and you know, the crew is there and there's piles of lumber (00:20:01:17 - 00:20:06:22)

Ryan: and you watch the sun come up and then, you know, (00:20:06:22 - 00:20:10:08)

Ryan: you hear the sound of the nail guns and the saws going in, the fresh lumber (00:20:10:08 - 00:20:14:06)

Ryan: smell, and everyone's busy and the sun the on your back or in your face. (00:20:14:06 - 00:20:19:11)

Ryan: And it's just a feeling (00:20:19:11 - 00:20:20:18)

Ryan: like you have a real purpose. (00:20:21:19 - 00:20:23:08)

Ryan: Like, you know, today is going to be a good day. (00:20:23:08 - 00:20:26:15)

Ryan: So for me, it's it's just kind of there. (00:20:26:15 - 00:20:30:13)

Ryan: I don't, (00:20:30:14 - 00:20:31:10)

Ryan: you know, my, my, my father, (00:20:32:05 - 00:20:35:04)

Ryan: I really didn't follow in anyone's footsteps as far as the trade work goes. (00:20:35:04 - 00:20:39:01)

Ryan: It's just always interested me. And (00:20:39:01 - 00:20:41:09)

Ryan: once I started doing it, it became more and more apparent that, (00:20:42:22 - 00:20:47:09)

Ryan: Hey, I think I've found what I'm good at. (00:20:48:06 - 00:20:50:20)

Ryan: And for that I'm blessed. (00:20:51:19 - 00:20:53:10)

Ryan: It wasn't it wasn't really ever about the money for me. (00:20:53:10 - 00:20:58:11)

Ryan: It was about learning. (00:20:58:11 - 00:21:00:06)

Ryan: I've met some of the most incredible people in my life (00:21:00:06 - 00:21:03:19)

Ryan: working as a as a carpenter, some of my best days and worst. (00:21:04:00 - 00:21:08:20)

Ryan: I couldn't lie about that. (00:21:08:20 - 00:21:10:02)

Ryan: But some of my best days have been spent building houses. (00:21:10:02 - 00:21:15:07)

Ryan: I wouldn't trade it for for anything. (00:21:15:07 - 00:21:17:19)

Ryan: So I feel lucky for that. (00:21:17:19 - 00:21:19:13)

Ryan: You know, I think maybe (00:21:19:13 - 00:21:20:13)

Ryan: maybe people are meant to do certain things. (00:21:22:14 - 00:21:24:21)

Ryan: I don't know. (00:21:24:22 - 00:21:26:01)

Ryan: I like to believe that I have a lot of other interests, (00:21:26:01 - 00:21:29:23)

Ryan: but I don't feel the way I feel about framing about anything else (00:21:29:23 - 00:21:35:04)

Ryan: as far as my my passion and interest for it. (00:21:35:12 - 00:21:38:08)

Ryan: You know, we go we go on vacation or I'm with my family (00:21:39:02 - 00:21:42:23)

Ryan: and we're all having a conversation in the truck and here comes a framing job. (00:21:42:23 - 00:21:47:00)

Ryan: We drive by and (00:21:47:00 - 00:21:48:19)

Ryan: I just get pulled out of the conversation and I'm looking at the guys. (00:21:48:19 - 00:21:52:06)

Ryan: And while that's cool and I'm trying to guess what the roof pitches are working on (00:21:52:06 - 00:21:56:02)

Ryan: and I'm noticing (00:21:56:02 - 00:21:57:08)

Ryan: all the little things, you know, and then I'm back in the conversation. (00:21:57:08 - 00:22:00:18)

Ryan: It's just, it's just part of who I am, (00:22:00:18 - 00:22:02:17)

Ryan: which I'll take that. (00:22:03:16 - 00:22:05:17)

Ryan: I'm okay with that. (00:22:05:17 - 00:22:08:16)

Ryan: Once I just just realize that the (00:22:08:16 - 00:22:11:14)

Ryan: people oh, you know, (00:22:13:02 - 00:22:15:08)

Ryan: I have a theory. (00:22:15:08 - 00:22:24:15)

Ryan: I wonder if it's actually coming from the exact same (00:22:24:15 - 00:22:28:10)

Ryan: things you even know. (00:22:31:03 - 00:22:32:13)

Ryan: So you just got to the more, I guess, right? (00:22:32:13 - 00:22:55:10)

Ryan: Right. But (00:22:56:06 - 00:23:09:17)

Ryan: also, yeah, um. (00:23:11:16 - 00:23:15:13)

Ryan: I think that's really cool to they described it earlier too. (00:23:17:16 - 00:23:20:11)

Ryan: Like, you know, I don't think every kid who like, (00:23:20:13 - 00:23:23:16)

Ryan: you know, remembers like their parents generation or anything like that of Oh, (00:23:24:07 - 00:23:28:14)

Ryan: look how cool it is to see what's inside you and all of that, you know? (00:23:28:14 - 00:23:31:17)

Ryan: Yeah. Protected me. (00:23:31:17 - 00:23:33:09)

Ryan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (00:23:33:09 - 00:23:35:14)

Ryan: So it sounds like there's always been (00:23:35:14 - 00:23:38:05)

Ryan: some form of emotional connection to, you know, the constructed world around you. (00:23:38:05 - 00:23:44:13)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:23:45:06 - 00:23:45:20)

Ryan: So I guess I'm curious, kind of like, (00:23:45:23 - 00:23:47:07)

Ryan: you know, and that's, that's one thing I think about a lot doing this (00:23:47:07 - 00:23:49:23)

Ryan: type of media is like, you know, the big picture here is shelter, (00:23:49:23 - 00:23:54:15)

Ryan: which is obviously an essential human need and our improvements. (00:23:55:12 - 00:23:59:08)

Ryan: Yeah, sure. (00:23:59:14 - 00:24:01:14)

Ryan: Have advanced civilizations. So (00:24:01:14 - 00:24:03:12)

Ryan: the first thing I think (00:24:04:19 - 00:24:05:20)

Ryan: of when I think of shelter is the roof. (00:24:05:20 - 00:24:08:20)

Ryan: Me too. (00:24:08:20 - 00:24:09:23)

Ryan: Over your head. Yeah. (00:24:09:23 - 00:24:11:21)

Ryan: Um, yeah. (00:24:11:21 - 00:24:13:14)

Ryan: So I wonder. (00:24:13:14 - 00:24:14:04)

Ryan: Yeah, like, is there, (00:24:14:04 - 00:24:17:07)

Ryan: you know, what's the you know, (00:24:17:07 - 00:24:19:17)

Ryan: I mean, you're you're a great writer, as I've seen. (00:24:19:17 - 00:24:21:12)

Ryan: So I'm curious, kind of like, what's your poetic connection to the roof itself. (00:24:21:12 - 00:24:30:06)

Ryan: The roof aspect (00:24:30:06 - 00:24:33:00)

Ryan: and a house to me? (00:24:33:00 - 00:24:34:06)

Ryan: Well, obviously, that's one of the all the parts that are important to me. (00:24:34:06 - 00:24:38:17)

Ryan: I would say the roof is more most important, (00:24:38:17 - 00:24:40:17)

Ryan: but I'm going to be partial to that. (00:24:40:17 - 00:24:43:10)

Ryan: But to me, the roof defines us. (00:24:43:10 - 00:24:46:04)

Ryan: It kind of tells the story of the walls below because the shape of the roof (00:24:46:23 - 00:24:51:17)

Ryan: follows the shape of the house. (00:24:52:21 - 00:24:55:01)

Ryan: So whether it's, you know, a big old house with wall (00:24:55:01 - 00:24:58:13)

Ryan: jugs everywhere, it's going to have lots of hips and valleys. (00:24:58:13 - 00:25:01:18)

Ryan: Or if it's a more subtle, simple house that's more square or rectangular shaped, (00:25:01:18 - 00:25:07:12)

Ryan: that roof is going to present itself in a different light as well. So (00:25:08:00 - 00:25:12:05)

Ryan: for me, when I'm up (00:25:13:14 - 00:25:15:18)

Ryan: inside the roof in the attic and we're putting it together, (00:25:16:17 - 00:25:20:03)

Ryan: you tend to get intimate with it. (00:25:21:15 - 00:25:23:17)

Ryan: When you set a vaguely, you go right to your your memory (00:25:23:17 - 00:25:27:21)

Ryan: of cutting and figuring and without even turning around, (00:25:27:21 - 00:25:31:15)

Ryan: you know, there's an inside corner there on the elevation view. (00:25:31:15 - 00:25:35:21)

Ryan: And then from looking at the prints for the whole time, you know, (00:25:35:21 - 00:25:39:20)

Ryan: hey, we're over the master bedroom because I labeled (00:25:39:20 - 00:25:43:04)

Ryan: that the for so (00:25:43:04 - 00:25:46:09)

Ryan: the situational awareness (00:25:46:09 - 00:25:49:08)

Ryan: while I'm on site actually assembling a roof (00:25:49:08 - 00:25:52:03)

Ryan: is unique to me because all the guys that I'm (00:25:53:10 - 00:25:56:20)

Ryan: with haven't been through that process that I've already burned. (00:25:56:20 - 00:26:00:22)

Ryan: I've already assembled the roof in my mind, multiple times. (00:26:00:22 - 00:26:05:01)

Ryan: So the roof (00:26:05:01 - 00:26:07:20)

Ryan: is unique to each dwelling (00:26:09:18 - 00:26:11:21)

Ryan: and it really does tell the story in so many ways. (00:26:12:04 - 00:26:15:07)

Ryan: When you look at them from above (00:26:15:15 - 00:26:17:21)

Ryan: and you're looking at the roof lines, it follows the exact shape of the house. (00:26:17:21 - 00:26:21:19)

Ryan: And then sometimes they throw little flares, (00:26:21:19 - 00:26:24:10)

Ryan: you know, maybe a turret roof or a bay or and those are cool little to me. (00:26:25:00 - 00:26:30:09)

Ryan: They're always like (00:26:30:09 - 00:26:31:07)

Ryan: personality. (00:26:32:15 - 00:26:33:22)

Ryan: I think each roof has a personality to it. (00:26:33:22 - 00:26:36:17)

Ryan: And they almost they almost talk to you. (00:26:37:01 - 00:26:39:18)

Ryan: You know, some are aggressive and they're very steep and they're cut up (00:26:40:03 - 00:26:44:03)

Ryan: and there's hips and valleys all over where there didn't need to be. (00:26:44:03 - 00:26:47:16)

Ryan: It could have been straight gables and easier roofline. (00:26:47:16 - 00:26:50:19)

Ryan: So they have a more robust, (00:26:50:19 - 00:26:53:19)

Ryan: sort of aggressive nature to them. (00:26:54:10 - 00:26:56:10)

Ryan: At least that's how I see them while others. (00:26:57:02 - 00:27:00:14)

Ryan: So sorry. (00:27:00:15 - 00:27:02:00)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:27:02:03 - 00:27:02:10)

Ryan: Now I hear why isn't the cable deployment the shot that was in. (00:27:02:10 - 00:27:07:15)

Ryan: I can adjust it. (00:27:07:20 - 00:27:09:20)

Ryan: I think that was the fix. (00:27:09:20 - 00:27:13:02)

Ryan: AKC Yeah, so we send the cable back first again. (00:27:13:02 - 00:27:17:08)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:27:17:16 - 00:27:20:05)

Ryan: Genius Doyle Simple that (00:27:20:05 - 00:27:22:11)

Ryan: give. (00:27:25:13 - 00:27:25:22)

Ryan: A lot of math with the. (00:27:27:21 - 00:27:29:17)

Ryan: I haven't thought about any of this stuff in so long. (00:27:37:23 - 00:27:40:04)

Ryan: Right. It's great that you're asking. (00:27:40:12 - 00:27:42:12)

Ryan: Oh yeah, that's cool. (00:27:42:12 - 00:27:45:22)

Ryan: Now I feel old like the last 22 years, just. (00:27:45:22 - 00:27:49:05)

Ryan: I don't know where they want. (00:27:49:06 - 00:27:53:07)

Ryan: Yeah. Let's not lose that train, though. Yeah. I'm so sorry. (00:27:53:07 - 00:27:55:14)

Ryan: I love that. I just think personality (00:27:55:15 - 00:27:58:05)

Ryan: values like. (00:27:59:16 - 00:28:01:22)

Ryan: Yeah, those. (00:28:01:22 - 00:28:02:11)

Ryan: Those great (00:28:02:11 - 00:28:03:10)

Ryan: Joey's upside down. (00:28:10:09 - 00:28:11:15)

Ryan: Yeah, it's like you put your (00:28:11:15 - 00:28:15:20)

Ryan: foot down. (00:28:17:05 - 00:28:17:17)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:28:17:17 - 00:28:21:19)

Ryan: Physically. (00:28:21:19 - 00:28:25:01)

Ryan: There you go. Well, there you go. There. (00:28:25:01 - 00:28:27:20)

Ryan: No. Yeah, but this doesn't want to rotate. (00:28:28:03 - 00:28:32:21)

Ryan: Yeah, you got to lock it. Well. (00:28:33:03 - 00:28:35:01)

Ryan: You almost had it. Almost. (00:28:35:01 - 00:28:37:07)

Ryan: There you go. (00:28:37:07 - 00:28:38:01)

Ryan: There's (00:28:38:01 - 00:28:38:17)

Ryan: technology. (00:28:40:23 - 00:28:41:21)

Ryan: All right. (00:28:41:21 - 00:28:42:17)

Ryan: The little interior to a straight up mirror. (00:28:42:23 - 00:28:45:06)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:28:45:07 - 00:28:46:01)

Ryan: Is right. (00:28:47:12 - 00:28:54:09)

Ryan: Yeah. But this is helping, right. With the. (00:28:54:19 - 00:28:57:10)

Ryan: Oh, yeah, this is great. (00:28:57:10 - 00:28:59:10)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:28:59:10 - 00:29:04:00)

Ryan: For for this. (00:29:04:00 - 00:29:05:01)

Ryan: It's like it's perfect. (00:29:05:01 - 00:29:06:07)

Ryan: I don't know that it would have been helpful. (00:29:06:07 - 00:29:08:04)

Ryan: Yeah, no, you were right. (00:29:08:04 - 00:29:09:13)

Ryan: Yeah, I think that was fun. (00:29:09:13 - 00:29:11:07)

Ryan: That's I of feel like. Yeah, human to human. (00:29:11:07 - 00:29:13:18)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:29:14:09 - 00:29:21:20)

Ryan: How's the Mike Allen. Okay, great. (00:29:21:20 - 00:29:24:01)

Ryan: Okay. (00:29:24:01 - 00:29:27:11)

Ryan: Well, good. Worked for 18 earlier and (00:29:27:11 - 00:29:30:13)

Ryan: cool. (00:29:32:05 - 00:29:32:12)

Ryan: All right, so you're riffing on the personality of the Hudson Valley. (00:29:32:12 - 00:29:35:04)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:29:35:12 - 00:29:35:22)

Ryan: And some some roofs are more. (00:29:35:22 - 00:29:38:22)

Ryan: Much more simple, straightforward, forward and and subtle, (00:29:38:22 - 00:29:42:20)

Ryan: which give a feeling of. (00:29:42:20 - 00:29:46:02)

Ryan: It's kind of like when you go home to visit your folks after a while (00:29:46:02 - 00:29:49:11)

Ryan: and you feel like, you know, you just feel good inside. (00:29:49:11 - 00:29:52:06)

Ryan: Sometimes an easy roof will give me that feeling (00:29:52:20 - 00:29:56:19)

Ryan: because it's not challenging me (00:29:56:19 - 00:29:59:19)

Ryan: as much as maybe a more as I, (00:30:00:06 - 00:30:02:23)

Ryan: as I think I put it, aggressive type of roof. (00:30:03:00 - 00:30:06:07)

Ryan: So when I approach, you know, when I first get the blueprint and I approach, (00:30:07:07 - 00:30:11:11)

Ryan: you know, all of my methodology that I use, I'm kind of at ease (00:30:11:19 - 00:30:15:20)

Ryan: because I know it's really not a big challenge. (00:30:15:20 - 00:30:19:19)

Ryan: So we kind of become friends in the beginning because I know (00:30:20:07 - 00:30:23:07)

Ryan: you're not going to stomp me. (00:30:23:17 - 00:30:25:14)

Ryan: You're not going to, you know, trip me up. (00:30:25:14 - 00:30:28:00)

Ryan: So we're going to have a good week together. (00:30:28:03 - 00:30:30:10)

Ryan: And then when we go out and put it together, it's like I like (00:30:30:10 - 00:30:34:01)

Ryan: I love those roofs the best on a Friday, (00:30:34:01 - 00:30:36:21)

Ryan: a nice, straightforward, easy roof that was (00:30:37:09 - 00:30:40:10)

Ryan: friendly the whole time through the figuring and the building, (00:30:41:16 - 00:30:44:17)

Ryan: even to the roof sheathing when those happen on a Friday, (00:30:45:00 - 00:30:48:14)

Ryan: that is a magical weekend for me because it's just like, oh, yeah, oh, (00:30:48:14 - 00:30:54:16)

Ryan: there wasn't a whole bunch of stress and anxiety that and that. (00:30:54:17 - 00:30:59:10)

Ryan: That does come with some of the more challenging (00:30:59:10 - 00:31:02:19)

Ryan: roofs. (00:31:04:02 - 00:31:04:23)

Ryan: And I always welcome that because I do (00:31:05:11 - 00:31:07:15)

Ryan: like a challenge and I like to be it keeps me sharp. (00:31:07:15 - 00:31:10:09)

Ryan: As I mentioned before you you get intimate with these. (00:31:11:00 - 00:31:13:16)

Ryan: So some of them will keep me on my toes and keep me up at night (00:31:13:16 - 00:31:17:18)

Ryan: like a lot of nights (00:31:19:04 - 00:31:20:23)

Ryan: until we for me, the reward there is one. (00:31:20:23 - 00:31:24:20)

Ryan: We're on the on site and everything has gone together (00:31:24:20 - 00:31:27:19)

Ryan: with very small hiccups and to happen the truck at the end of the day and see it (00:31:28:17 - 00:31:33:15)

Ryan: together, it's the same feeling of, you know, a sigh of relief. (00:31:33:15 - 00:31:37:23)

Ryan: And then at that point, (00:31:38:16 - 00:31:39:22)

Ryan: I think I become friends with that roof (00:31:41:00 - 00:31:43:19)

Ryan: that has just been kind of a bully to me for the last couple of weeks. (00:31:43:19 - 00:31:48:04)

Ryan: Well, I never I've never been angry with one. (00:31:49:01 - 00:31:51:04)

Ryan: Feels weird to talk about a roof like that. (00:31:51:04 - 00:31:53:00)

Ryan: But for me, that's that's really what they are. (00:31:53:00 - 00:31:55:16)

Ryan: Some are challenges the whole time and some are friendly (00:31:56:00 - 00:32:00:08)

Ryan: and easy and more, you know, (00:32:00:08 - 00:32:03:03)

Ryan: feminine, if you will, (00:32:04:21 - 00:32:06:05)

Ryan: you know, pretty and you know, all of that. (00:32:06:05 - 00:32:08:22)

Ryan: So I hope there are other carpenters that can relate to this. (00:32:09:10 - 00:32:15:00)

Ryan: Otherwise I might be the weirdest dude in the world. (00:32:15:00 - 00:32:19:20)

Ryan: I talk to my project, man. (00:32:19:20 - 00:32:21:20)

Ryan: You have to. (00:32:21:20 - 00:32:22:16)

Ryan: Yeah, you have. (00:32:22:16 - 00:32:23:10)

Ryan: To know, I actually love this idea of personifying (00:32:23:10 - 00:32:26:01)

Ryan: what your what you're assembling and what you're building. (00:32:27:01 - 00:32:29:22)

Ryan: So to take that maybe even further, (00:32:29:22 - 00:32:31:21)

Ryan: it seems like whether it's an easy roof or a hard roof, (00:32:31:21 - 00:32:34:16)

Ryan: whether you guys have struggled or, you know, talked well together, (00:32:34:16 - 00:32:39:06)

Ryan: the end goal is protection to protect the family below. (00:32:39:06 - 00:32:44:10)

Ryan: Oh, yeah, yeah. (00:32:44:22 - 00:32:48:15)

Ryan: That that is such a reward. (00:32:48:15 - 00:32:51:04)

Ryan: Basically, we're building we're providing a service, right? (00:32:51:22 - 00:32:55:14)

Ryan: A basic human need, as you've mentioned, everyone needs shelter. (00:32:55:14 - 00:32:59:09)

Ryan: But more importantly, to see the excitement on the homeowners (00:32:59:20 - 00:33:04:02)

Ryan: faces when they stop. (00:33:04:02 - 00:33:05:04)

Ryan: We're building people's dreams, right? (00:33:05:04 - 00:33:07:21)

Ryan: We're turning a vision (00:33:08:00 - 00:33:09:23)

Ryan: that they have into a reality right before their eyes. (00:33:11:07 - 00:33:14:11)

Ryan: And to be a part of that, it's something that (00:33:14:11 - 00:33:17:16)

Ryan: becomes part of your fabric. (00:33:19:07 - 00:33:22:01)

Ryan: You know, you spend the more years you do this, (00:33:22:01 - 00:33:24:15)

Ryan: the more of those moments and feelings you kind of you keep them with you. (00:33:24:15 - 00:33:29:10)

Ryan: It's almost like you have a suitcase and you just you fire these these feelings (00:33:29:17 - 00:33:34:23)

Ryan: and these memories and they're and it's great to look back and recall on them. (00:33:34:23 - 00:33:39:18)

Ryan: I take a lot of photos nowadays. (00:33:40:03 - 00:33:42:12)

Ryan: It's with cell phone. (00:33:42:12 - 00:33:43:19)

Ryan: We all have amazing cameras, right on our phone. (00:33:43:19 - 00:33:45:23)

Ryan: But going back to the beginning, (00:33:45:23 - 00:33:48:07)

Ryan: it was a regular Kodak camera that I would have, you know, develop. (00:33:48:07 - 00:33:52:14)

Ryan: And then I would (00:33:52:23 - 00:33:53:14)

Ryan: you know, I had purchased my first digital camera and my wife and I. So (00:33:53:14 - 00:33:57:04)

Ryan: I've always taken pictures of the entire process. (00:33:58:11 - 00:34:01:23)

Ryan: Now it's more the roof stuff because it's really gripped my interest for so long. (00:34:01:23 - 00:34:07:02)

Ryan: But yeah, being a part of someone else's dreams and, (00:34:07:14 - 00:34:12:04)

Ryan: and seeing the joy that our efforts have brought (00:34:12:08 - 00:34:15:23)

Ryan: and the smiles and getting to meet all these different people, you know? (00:34:15:23 - 00:34:20:07)

Ryan: But, you know, you build a house for a young family, a couple with a small child (00:34:20:08 - 00:34:24:17)

Ryan: or or a couple with multiple children that just needed a bigger house or, (00:34:24:17 - 00:34:29:07)

Ryan: you know, you name it, every walk of life. (00:34:29:22 - 00:34:32:14)

Ryan: And to share in that, for me, (00:34:33:14 - 00:34:35:17)

Ryan: you couldn't put a price on that. (00:34:37:10 - 00:34:39:08)

Ryan: You couldn't. (00:34:39:08 - 00:34:40:07)

Ryan: And I hope that (00:34:40:07 - 00:34:42:03)

Ryan: as a carpenter that we've left our mark (00:34:43:02 - 00:34:45:22)

Ryan: on these people much in the same way (00:34:46:20 - 00:34:49:10)

Ryan: that they have us, even (00:34:50:17 - 00:34:52:01)

Ryan: though our work isn't seen once leave it all gets covered, right? (00:34:52:01 - 00:34:56:06)

Ryan: Drywall, insulation, paint, trim. (00:34:56:06 - 00:34:59:01)

Ryan: Carpenters come in and make it look beautiful with trim and fancy words. (00:34:59:01 - 00:35:03:19)

Ryan: And a roofer roofing company shows up and puts shingles down. (00:35:03:19 - 00:35:07:22)

Ryan: Or so everything that we've kind of poured our soul into does get covered up, but (00:35:07:23 - 00:35:13:15)

Ryan: it's the bones, it's the skeleton (00:35:14:11 - 00:35:16:16)

Ryan: of the house that these families will spend the rest of their days. (00:35:17:02 - 00:35:20:17)

Ryan: And to be a part of that, (00:35:20:17 - 00:35:23:09)

Ryan: there's a lot to be said for that means a lot to me, whether you see it or not. (00:35:23:09 - 00:35:27:03)

Ryan: I can still see it in my mind and photographs. So (00:35:27:03 - 00:35:30:11)

Ryan: yeah, it's cool how, how all the trades kind of rely on one (00:35:31:17 - 00:35:35:23)

Ryan: another and come together and to be one of the first ones in (00:35:35:23 - 00:35:39:13)

Ryan: feels kind of neat, you know, it's almost like the team captain, (00:35:40:10 - 00:35:44:16)

Ryan: you know, trim, carpenter, drywall or electricians. (00:35:45:05 - 00:35:48:12)

Ryan: We all work in unison, but without the framing contractor (00:35:48:14 - 00:35:51:20)

Ryan: and the framing carpenters is there's no house there. (00:35:51:20 - 00:35:54:16)

Ryan: So it's it's pretty neat when I think about it like that. (00:35:55:14 - 00:35:58:16)

Ryan: You give the phrase a real meaning, right? (00:36:00:01 - 00:36:03:09)

Ryan: Like these families are meeting the guy, (00:36:03:10 - 00:36:06:03)

Ryan: putting the roof above their head. (00:36:06:20 - 00:36:09:12)

Ryan: Yeah, yeah. And (00:36:09:12 - 00:36:13:01)

Ryan: I talk about that a lot nowadays and say, you know. (00:36:13:04 - 00:36:16:22)

Ryan: What do you say? (00:36:17:06 - 00:36:18:02)

Ryan: Well, the homeowner, you know, they'll approach us or even the builder, (00:36:18:02 - 00:36:21:12)

Ryan: even if it's not the homeowner, if they're not present, (00:36:21:12 - 00:36:23:13)

Ryan: you know, wow, this is great. (00:36:24:09 - 00:36:26:07)

Ryan: It's amazing how much you guys got done. (00:36:26:07 - 00:36:28:11)

Ryan: I'll always turn that into, yeah, you got a great roof. (00:36:28:11 - 00:36:31:03)

Ryan: You know, see all these hips and valleys and yeah, usually have no idea (00:36:31:03 - 00:36:35:12)

Ryan: what I'm talking about, but I love to engage them (00:36:35:12 - 00:36:38:15)

Ryan: and show them like walk around the house and say, you know, that's an irregular hip (00:36:39:00 - 00:36:42:12)

Ryan: and that's an irregular valley. (00:36:42:12 - 00:36:43:21)

Ryan: And this roof's incredibly of multiple pitches. (00:36:43:21 - 00:36:46:19)

Ryan: And this area here, we was difficult for us. (00:36:46:19 - 00:36:49:20)

Ryan: And so I give them kind of a sense of, (00:36:49:20 - 00:36:53:13)

Ryan: oh, wow, there's a lot that probably goes into this (00:36:54:01 - 00:36:57:10)

Ryan: that we didn't realize, you know, which I think that's important for all people. (00:36:57:10 - 00:37:01:20)

Ryan: We all need to appreciate one another. (00:37:02:04 - 00:37:04:07)

Ryan: You know, when, when, when you get hurt, you go and put all of your trust (00:37:05:00 - 00:37:10:01)

Ryan: into a nurse or a doctor without even thinking about it. (00:37:10:01 - 00:37:13:03)

Ryan: Right. (00:37:13:03 - 00:37:15:23)

Ryan: We all need to be like that in the trades. (00:37:15:23 - 00:37:18:10)

Ryan: I trust that, you know, the foundation guy is going to do his job (00:37:18:10 - 00:37:22:08)

Ryan: accordingly and then, you know, they're trusting that we're going to put (00:37:22:19 - 00:37:26:05)

Ryan: a structural house that's structurally sound on top of that. (00:37:26:05 - 00:37:29:10)

Ryan: And then all the trades that follow suit. (00:37:29:10 - 00:37:31:10)

Ryan: And I think we all need to help each other. (00:37:32:07 - 00:37:34:00)

Ryan: If there's something you can do to make it easy for the next guy coming in. (00:37:34:00 - 00:37:37:06)

Ryan: Right? (00:37:38:08 - 00:37:38:21)

Ryan: Why wouldn't we do that? (00:37:38:21 - 00:37:40:20)

Ryan: But yeah, I really enjoy conversing with homeowners. (00:37:40:20 - 00:37:44:07)

Ryan: The the excitement that they share. (00:37:44:07 - 00:37:46:05)

Ryan: It's the little things you kind of lock away, put them in your pocket. (00:37:46:05 - 00:37:49:22)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:37:50:23 - 00:37:51:06)

Ryan: It's always usually a good experience. (00:37:51:06 - 00:37:54:12)

Ryan: You're describing something that, you know, I've been encountering (00:37:54:12 - 00:37:58:03)

Ryan: while making these courses, which is, um, (00:37:59:11 - 00:38:01:11)

Ryan: just how much goes into each trade. (00:38:02:12 - 00:38:04:11)

Ryan: But I do feel like roofing in particular, especially reframing (00:38:04:11 - 00:38:07:15)

Ryan: like literally no idea. (00:38:09:18 - 00:38:11:11)

Ryan: Like there's so much and (00:38:11:11 - 00:38:13:20)

Ryan: oh yeah, the average person to understanding (00:38:14:00 - 00:38:17:05)

Ryan: the complexity is like, why is that so to reframing. (00:38:17:05 - 00:38:23:08)

Ryan: Well, I think the biggest reason it's (00:38:23:08 - 00:38:26:05)

Ryan: even in our own trade, trade specific (00:38:27:01 - 00:38:29:02)

Ryan: to framing carpentry is the onset of roof trusses. (00:38:29:05 - 00:38:32:18)

Ryan: They've been around for 30 or 40 years, (00:38:33:02 - 00:38:36:15)

Ryan: I would have to guess, not really sure, but they've been around my entire career, (00:38:36:15 - 00:38:40:12)

Ryan: so I feel like that's kind of killed our craft in a way. (00:38:41:02 - 00:38:45:09)

Ryan: There's career long framing carpenters who may feel (00:38:45:23 - 00:38:49:04)

Ryan: the same way I do about what they do, but they've never had the opportunity (00:38:49:09 - 00:38:53:09)

Ryan: to do it in the (00:38:54:08 - 00:38:55:02)

Ryan: old fashioned way or stick framing, as we call it, (00:38:55:02 - 00:38:58:08)

Ryan: because it just wasn't the way it was done in their area. (00:38:58:21 - 00:39:01:22)

Ryan: So I think a lot of light isn't (00:39:03:07 - 00:39:05:01)

Ryan: shed on what we do because it was more popular (00:39:05:01 - 00:39:08:14)

Ryan: 50 years ago. (00:39:09:13 - 00:39:12:10)

Ryan: To me, everything about a stick frame roof is better (00:39:12:10 - 00:39:15:12)

Ryan: than a manufactured truss. (00:39:15:12 - 00:39:18:18)

Ryan: That's an argument I've with lumber salesmen (00:39:18:21 - 00:39:23:01)

Ryan: and other carpenters, you know, social media. (00:39:23:01 - 00:39:25:22)

Ryan: Gosh. (00:39:26:23 - 00:39:28:00)

Ryan: But it has taken (00:39:28:05 - 00:39:30:16)

Ryan: it has removed the craftsman portion (00:39:30:16 - 00:39:34:15)

Ryan: from that step and framing a house everything up until that point (00:39:34:20 - 00:39:40:07)

Ryan: is the same. (00:39:40:17 - 00:39:42:00)

Ryan: But a truss crew knows when they get to second floor walls (00:39:42:01 - 00:39:46:14)

Ryan: or if it's a ranch when they're done with walls, that the trust company (00:39:47:14 - 00:39:50:18)

Ryan: will drop off their trusses (00:39:51:10 - 00:39:52:22)

Ryan: and they'll run a crane and they'll just set the whole roof (00:39:52:22 - 00:39:56:05)

Ryan: ceiling included where we're rolling our ceiling (00:39:56:18 - 00:39:59:11)

Ryan: and nailing them to each wall and making all of the cuts. (00:39:59:20 - 00:40:02:19)

Ryan: So there's there's a lot more involved. (00:40:02:19 - 00:40:06:23)

Ryan: When you stick frame, you're responsible for the length of every board. (00:40:07:06 - 00:40:11:00)

Ryan: Nothing is being provided. (00:40:11:09 - 00:40:12:19)

Ryan: It's a pile of sticks on day one. (00:40:12:19 - 00:40:14:15)

Ryan: And at the end, you know, (00:40:14:15 - 00:40:16:04)

Ryan: you have a recreation of the blueprint that you've been using all along. (00:40:16:04 - 00:40:20:18)

Ryan: So I'm grateful for that. If (00:40:20:18 - 00:40:23:08)

Ryan: if trusses come in and take over, I'm out. (00:40:24:19 - 00:40:28:03)

Ryan: I'll move. (00:40:28:07 - 00:40:29:10)

Ryan: I'll have to follow where the stick framing is. (00:40:29:10 - 00:40:31:21)

Ryan: There's no doubt about it. (00:40:31:21 - 00:40:32:19)

Ryan: It's just part of who I am. (00:40:32:19 - 00:40:35:00)

Ryan: So I think that's the biggest probably reason (00:40:35:00 - 00:40:38:07)

Ryan: it's not so appreciated anymore. (00:40:38:07 - 00:40:40:15)

Ryan: Which is kind of like, you know, the age old narrative of technology, right? (00:40:42:10 - 00:40:46:08)

Ryan: Yeah, exactly. (00:40:46:14 - 00:40:48:01)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:40:48:01 - 00:40:48:20)

Ryan: Sometimes (00:40:48:20 - 00:40:50:12)

Ryan: new isn't always better or, (00:40:51:12 - 00:40:53:20)

Ryan: you know, the other the other side of the fence, as they say. (00:40:53:23 - 00:40:56:13)

Ryan: The idea I admire, I think it's great, which it's really what we're doing here (00:40:56:20 - 00:41:01:13)

Ryan: in this inside the shop where prefab and around pre cutting the roof (00:41:01:13 - 00:41:06:08)

Ryan: so we are actually faster stick framing the roof (00:41:06:08 - 00:41:11:01)

Ryan: than we are having trusses and we've proven this quite a few times. (00:41:11:01 - 00:41:16:14)

Ryan: We don't use trusses often. (00:41:16:14 - 00:41:18:13)

Ryan: Sometimes there's no way around it. (00:41:18:13 - 00:41:20:12)

Ryan: It was the house was drawn that way. (00:41:20:12 - 00:41:23:00)

Ryan: The architect, the way the house was engineered, (00:41:23:00 - 00:41:25:03)

Ryan: they just don't want to switch it to rafters and we need the work. (00:41:25:09 - 00:41:28:23)

Ryan: So we take the job. (00:41:28:23 - 00:41:30:16)

Ryan: Those ones are (00:41:30:16 - 00:41:31:10)

Ryan: always a bummer for me, but you know, you got to do what you have to do. (00:41:31:10 - 00:41:34:16)

Ryan: We are markedly faster stick framing. (00:41:35:09 - 00:41:38:06)

Ryan: I would put us against any truss screw if I have everything cut, we're ready. (00:41:38:06 - 00:41:43:11)

Ryan: They have trusses on the ground. They're ready. (00:41:43:11 - 00:41:45:14)

Ryan: I bet you we're done first. (00:41:46:06 - 00:41:47:23)

Ryan: I would argue that all day long I would. (00:41:47:23 - 00:41:50:19)

Ryan: So the idea of trusses and pre-made, you know, in getting it to that level, (00:41:50:19 - 00:41:56:06)

Ryan: that's really what we're doing here. (00:41:57:08 - 00:41:59:15)

Ryan: We're just keeping the craftsmanship in it. (00:41:59:15 - 00:42:01:15)

Ryan: We're not relying on another company. (00:42:01:15 - 00:42:03:06)

Ryan: We're kind of keeping it in-house. (00:42:03:06 - 00:42:04:18)

Ryan: So yeah. (00:42:04:18 - 00:42:07:06)

Ryan: The other cool thing too is like we've had a chance to see how you apply (00:42:07:06 - 00:42:10:12)

Ryan: your own creative signature, you know, in subtle ways, but really, (00:42:10:12 - 00:42:14:15)

Ryan: you know, important ways both to you and to the people that you work with. (00:42:14:15 - 00:42:17:23)

Ryan: And you see your work. (00:42:17:23 - 00:42:19:17)

Ryan: You talk about, you know, how, how you build your own signature. (00:42:19:19 - 00:42:22:13)

Ryan: Yeah, I think, you know, it all stemmed (00:42:24:09 - 00:42:26:13)

Ryan: from that passion about it all. (00:42:26:13 - 00:42:29:17)

Ryan: You know, (00:42:29:17 - 00:42:30:12)

Ryan: you take something to a certain level as a person no matter what. (00:42:31:15 - 00:42:35:21)

Ryan: It is right for you. (00:42:35:21 - 00:42:37:13)

Ryan: If you're a musician, you're going to get to a point where you feel like, (00:42:37:13 - 00:42:41:15)

Ryan: Hey, I'm getting pretty good. (00:42:42:07 - 00:42:43:17)

Ryan: You know, I'm almost mastering this. (00:42:43:17 - 00:42:46:09)

Ryan: Do we complacent? (00:42:47:23 - 00:42:49:03)

Ryan: Do we stop there? (00:42:49:03 - 00:42:49:22)

Ryan: Do we keep reaching? (00:42:49:22 - 00:42:51:04)

Ryan: We always want to be better, right? (00:42:51:04 - 00:42:53:04)

Ryan: If if you feel that strongly about something, (00:42:53:04 - 00:42:55:14)

Ryan: it's an endless journey of learning about what (00:42:56:09 - 00:42:59:19)

Ryan: what what it is you're actually doing as well as learning about yourself. (00:42:59:23 - 00:43:02:23)

Ryan: So I think some of the little things that I do in regards to my cutting (00:43:03:16 - 00:43:07:15)

Ryan: and roof framing were just that, you know, hey, I've I've cut (00:43:07:15 - 00:43:12:13)

Ryan: 20,000 hip rafters. (00:43:13:09 - 00:43:15:13)

Ryan: How can I cut them differently to spice things up? (00:43:15:13 - 00:43:18:07)

Ryan: Right. (00:43:18:07 - 00:43:18:15)

Ryan: So I started figuring out and playing with, (00:43:18:15 - 00:43:20:15)

Ryan: you know, edge the and backing my shoulders. (00:43:21:06 - 00:43:23:05)

Ryan: So now I do that and I'm asked that question all the time, you know, (00:43:23:05 - 00:43:27:07)

Ryan: isn't that a waste of time? (00:43:27:11 - 00:43:29:08)

Ryan: You know, time is money. (00:43:29:08 - 00:43:30:21)

Ryan: I could have had that hip cut and nailed. (00:43:30:21 - 00:43:33:06)

Ryan: Yeah, maybe. (00:43:33:06 - 00:43:34:02)

Ryan: If maybe if you're, like, the fastest person in the world. (00:43:34:02 - 00:43:36:23)

Ryan: But I, I've demonstrated for you that it literally takes (00:43:36:23 - 00:43:40:04)

Ryan: just a few moments and the end results better. (00:43:40:04 - 00:43:43:05)

Ryan: And then the argument is, well, no one will ever see it. (00:43:43:05 - 00:43:45:21)

Ryan: You're going to cover it with plywood and then shingles and yeah, you're right. (00:43:45:21 - 00:43:49:18)

Ryan: You're absolutely right. (00:43:50:03 - 00:43:50:21)

Ryan: If that's if that's the angle you want to look at it from, fine. (00:43:50:21 - 00:43:54:04)

Ryan: I feel sorry for you. (00:43:54:04 - 00:43:55:11)

Ryan: I look at it as I spent my time away from (00:43:55:11 - 00:43:59:02)

Ryan: my wife and my children and everything that I love. (00:43:59:02 - 00:44:02:03)

Ryan: Cutting this roof. (00:44:03:10 - 00:44:05:11)

Ryan: I'm going to make it worth my while, you know, it makes me happy to do it. (00:44:05:12 - 00:44:09:12)

Ryan: So I do it up ridge boards. (00:44:09:12 - 00:44:12:03)

Ryan: I rip the crown out of all the ridge boards. (00:44:12:03 - 00:44:14:05)

Ryan: Even if I look at the ridge (00:44:14:05 - 00:44:15:12)

Ryan: and it's perfectly straight now, I just I have to make that cut. (00:44:15:12 - 00:44:18:22)

Ryan: It's just that one extra little thing (00:44:19:10 - 00:44:21:21)

Ryan: that makes me feel wholesome about what I'm doing. (00:44:22:08 - 00:44:26:07)

Ryan: So I think that, you know, those little things just came from, (00:44:26:07 - 00:44:30:16)

Ryan: hey, what can I do a little bit more, you know, now? (00:44:31:10 - 00:44:34:11)

Ryan: And, and as of lately, I've started wondering and I've even on a few roofs, (00:44:34:11 - 00:44:39:10)

Ryan: I've beveled the hips or the I'm sorry, the ridges. (00:44:39:10 - 00:44:42:10)

Ryan: So I'll have the ridge cut the pitch, cut into the ridge, which is, (00:44:42:18 - 00:44:46:17)

Ryan: you know, I like that I've been doing that more and more. (00:44:47:08 - 00:44:50:13)

Ryan: And then all the way down to the overhang, I've contemplated, (00:44:51:00 - 00:44:55:21)

Ryan: Hey, when I have the roof, maybe I'll have all the fascia material (00:44:56:15 - 00:44:59:20)

Ryan: and I can bevel it all. (00:45:00:03 - 00:45:01:07)

Ryan: So it matches the roof slope, right. (00:45:01:07 - 00:45:02:21)

Ryan: Really take it that far, which I'll probably try. (00:45:02:21 - 00:45:05:04)

Ryan: I have done it here and there on small things just to just to kind of see it. (00:45:05:17 - 00:45:09:20)

Ryan: And, you know, if it's, (00:45:09:23 - 00:45:12:15)

Ryan: if it's something that (00:45:14:02 - 00:45:16:07)

Ryan: I don't mind doing (00:45:16:16 - 00:45:18:20)

Ryan: or even if it takes a little longer, I'll spend the time, the extra time (00:45:19:11 - 00:45:23:10)

Ryan: just to make it so, you know, it doesn't really affect my productivity. (00:45:23:10 - 00:45:27:09)

Ryan: But every board I cut, I try to cut perfectly and I can't. (00:45:27:22 - 00:45:32:00)

Ryan: So that's fun to try to always be perfect (00:45:32:15 - 00:45:36:14)

Ryan: and we all know that's impossible, but it is fun to try. (00:45:36:22 - 00:45:41:03)

Ryan: So those little things, they just keep me happy. (00:45:41:06 - 00:45:44:12)

Ryan: That's kind of. It. (00:45:45:17 - 00:45:46:11)

Ryan: I mean, you know, it's an extension of you. (00:45:46:11 - 00:45:48:07)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:45:48:07 - 00:45:49:02)

Ryan: It's a way to express yourself, (00:45:50:03 - 00:45:52:07)

Ryan: you know, a lot of the guys, when I first started (00:45:52:07 - 00:45:56:02)

Ryan: doing it on on our crew or, you know, (00:45:56:02 - 00:45:59:02)

Ryan: at first, why why did you do that? (00:46:00:13 - 00:46:03:12)

Ryan: You know, speaking about hips and valleys and I don't know, because I can (00:46:03:12 - 00:46:07:18)

Ryan: because I wanted to look straight, you know, and through time, over (00:46:08:05 - 00:46:12:08)

Ryan: time of putting all these roofs together, same group of guys for so long. (00:46:12:08 - 00:46:16:14)

Ryan: They love it now, too, because it it helps them do their job better (00:46:16:19 - 00:46:20:10)

Ryan: because those pain points are there right there. (00:46:20:13 - 00:46:23:02)

Ryan: There's no question they're not citing a Jack (00:46:23:02 - 00:46:26:10)

Ryan: Rafter to the center of a square shouldered valley rafter. (00:46:26:10 - 00:46:30:04)

Ryan: I've plowed it out for them. (00:46:30:06 - 00:46:31:12)

Ryan: So they just line up the edge, few nails onto the next one. So (00:46:31:12 - 00:46:35:22)

Ryan: it's kind of yeah, that's just the way we do it now. (00:46:36:21 - 00:46:39:11)

Ryan: I'll never not do it that way. (00:46:39:11 - 00:46:41:05)

Ryan: Now, at this point, yeah. (00:46:41:05 - 00:46:44:09)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:46:45:12 - 00:46:45:20)

Ryan: I mean, like, why not put your mark on something that is (00:46:45:20 - 00:46:48:07)

Ryan: an extension of you. Exactly. (00:46:49:10 - 00:46:51:09)

Ryan: Why not. That makes you happy. (00:46:51:09 - 00:46:53:20)

Ryan: That's what I say. If it makes you happy, do it. (00:46:54:01 - 00:46:56:18)

Ryan: We only get so many trips around the sun, so do what makes you happy (00:46:56:18 - 00:47:00:01)

Ryan: for sure and enjoy the ride, right? (00:47:00:19 - 00:47:03:06)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:47:05:01 - 00:47:05:09)

Ryan: And the (00:47:05:09 - 00:47:07:06)

Ryan: you were touching on a point earlier (00:47:08:18 - 00:47:10:04)

Ryan: that I want to keep rolling on the (00:47:10:04 - 00:47:14:23)

Ryan: custom stick framing with. Um, (00:47:19:02 - 00:47:22:06)

Ryan: you know, it's, it's, it's, it's the reason we're here. (00:47:24:04 - 00:47:26:07)

Ryan: It's like process. (00:47:26:09 - 00:47:29:04)

Ryan: And, you know, we've talked throughout the week about how kind of (00:47:30:20 - 00:47:34:20)

Ryan: limited (00:47:35:22 - 00:47:37:07)

Ryan: conversation and access to that knowledge is. (00:47:38:06 - 00:47:41:01)

Ryan: But you've taken an initiative to share (00:47:41:01 - 00:47:43:19)

Ryan: what you know, like, you know, from, from within. You. (00:47:44:06 - 00:47:47:10)

Ryan: You've just self started (00:47:47:10 - 00:47:49:12)

Ryan: educating the masses out of (00:47:49:22 - 00:47:52:18)

Ryan: I think a passion for what you do, but also have a passion to, (00:47:52:19 - 00:47:55:12)

Ryan: to share the knowledge, (00:47:55:14 - 00:47:56:17)

Ryan: you know, I mean, you know, I'm talking definitely about your Instagram account. (00:47:56:17 - 00:47:59:16)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:48:00:01 - 00:48:00:13)

Ryan: And you know, the last five days have, um, have shown that, um, (00:48:00:14 - 00:48:04:01)

Ryan: you know, you have a natural penchant for teaching. (00:48:05:00 - 00:48:08:05)

Ryan: So that means a. (00:48:08:05 - 00:48:09:13)

Ryan: Lot like what, you know, what education (00:48:09:13 - 00:48:12:15)

Ryan: and sharing the knowledge of this trade. (00:48:12:23 - 00:48:17:23)

Ryan: You got started doing that. (00:48:17:23 - 00:48:22:01)

Ryan: So it was, you know, it was pretty clear to me the older I got, (00:48:22:01 - 00:48:26:17)

Ryan: you know, and I got more savvy with electronics (00:48:27:12 - 00:48:30:01)

Ryan: and our cell phones and there's social media and YouTube (00:48:30:01 - 00:48:34:12)

Ryan: and Instagram and Facebook and there's there's ways to connect (00:48:34:12 - 00:48:38:06)

Ryan: now that we didn't have when I started in this industry. So (00:48:38:06 - 00:48:42:20)

Ryan: I started realizing fairly quickly that, (00:48:44:09 - 00:48:48:02)

Ryan: wow, you are doing something a little different (00:48:49:13 - 00:48:53:02)

Ryan: than what everyone else is doing, or at least what I had found, (00:48:53:02 - 00:48:57:17)

Ryan: which then turned into, you know, I'd have (00:48:58:10 - 00:49:02:09)

Ryan: private messages (00:49:03:21 - 00:49:05:09)

Ryan: sent to me or emails question, you know, with questions regarding roof framing. (00:49:05:09 - 00:49:09:15)

Ryan: And I thought, could it be (00:49:09:15 - 00:49:11:20)

Ryan: could someone really care what I thought or how I do this? (00:49:12:04 - 00:49:16:12)

Ryan: And that became more apparent the more I started putting myself out there. (00:49:17:00 - 00:49:21:09)

Ryan: So I've tried to teach (00:49:21:09 - 00:49:24:07)

Ryan: as much as I can. (00:49:25:13 - 00:49:26:15)

Ryan: It's it's hard to find the time which I've been working on, (00:49:26:15 - 00:49:30:00)

Ryan: and I've been recording my own videos for some time now, very poorly (00:49:30:00 - 00:49:35:18)

Ryan: in comparison to what I've learned this week here with this has just been (00:49:35:18 - 00:49:39:12)

Ryan: my dream come true. (00:49:40:22 - 00:49:45:04)

Ryan: Explaining what you do (00:49:45:04 - 00:49:48:07)

Ryan: isn't always the easiest thing. (00:49:48:07 - 00:49:51:09)

Ryan: It's kind of like stream of consciousness. (00:49:51:09 - 00:49:53:23)

Ryan: That's right. (00:49:53:23 - 00:49:54:10)

Ryan: So when you're really in the moment and you're doing what you do, (00:49:54:10 - 00:49:57:18)

Ryan: I can explain it much easier than if I'm at a picnic table or having a picnic. (00:49:58:08 - 00:50:03:23)

Ryan: And some guy asks me, Hey, how do you, you know, lay out a hip rafter? (00:50:03:23 - 00:50:08:11)

Ryan: I could still get through it. (00:50:09:08 - 00:50:10:12)

Ryan: But most of the stuff that I've tried to teach has been basic stuff. (00:50:10:12 - 00:50:16:06)

Ryan: I've shared some more complicated things (00:50:16:06 - 00:50:18:16)

Ryan: as of lately. (00:50:19:21 - 00:50:23:00)

Ryan: I hope (00:50:23:00 - 00:50:24:09)

Ryan: that I'm received well. (00:50:25:08 - 00:50:27:06)

Ryan: It's, you know, it's it's it's had its ups and downs. (00:50:27:06 - 00:50:31:07)

Ryan: I do enjoy teaching. (00:50:31:07 - 00:50:33:03)

Ryan: I don't get enough feedback. (00:50:33:03 - 00:50:34:23)

Ryan: I get a lot of positive feedback. (00:50:34:23 - 00:50:36:12)

Ryan: I get a lot of negative feedback. (00:50:36:12 - 00:50:38:00)

Ryan: You know, you could cure cancer. (00:50:38:00 - 00:50:39:13)

Ryan: They're going to find a reason to hate you. (00:50:39:13 - 00:50:41:12)

Ryan: So that's been kind of what it is. (00:50:41:12 - 00:50:43:19)

Ryan: Whatever there's there's a lot of other amazing (00:50:43:19 - 00:50:46:21)

Ryan: people that I see every day (00:50:46:21 - 00:50:49:14)

Ryan: and Instagram, Facebook, that it's just very humbling (00:50:49:22 - 00:50:53:17)

Ryan: to see how talented and passionate other people are. (00:50:53:17 - 00:50:57:08)

Ryan: So if I could have a small piece of helping other people (00:50:57:08 - 00:51:02:07)

Ryan: progress with (00:51:03:14 - 00:51:04:23)

Ryan: reframing or framing in general, (00:51:04:23 - 00:51:08:20)

Ryan: that would be the biggest honor to me. (00:51:09:22 - 00:51:13:02)

Ryan: I would feel like (00:51:13:02 - 00:51:15:05)

Ryan: I kind of left my mark, you know, (00:51:15:12 - 00:51:17:11)

Ryan: as they say, you can't keep your trade until you give it away. (00:51:17:11 - 00:51:20:22)

Ryan: So I'm all about the education. (00:51:21:06 - 00:51:23:23)

Ryan: There wasn't there wasn't a lot there for me (00:51:23:23 - 00:51:26:02)

Ryan: growing up to learn from unless I found, you know, a book published (00:51:26:02 - 00:51:30:00)

Ryan: 30 years prior and at that point, the game had changed so much. (00:51:30:04 - 00:51:34:05)

Ryan: We haven't really kept the trades up to speed, at least mine. (00:51:34:19 - 00:51:38:11)

Ryan: I mean, we, we drive nails with hammers. (00:51:38:15 - 00:51:40:20)

Ryan: So it's not really and you need to wear a helmet. (00:51:40:20 - 00:51:43:11)

Ryan: So it's not like you have to be a rocket scientist. (00:51:43:11 - 00:51:46:02)

Ryan: But what we do, it's been it hasn't changed, as you said, shelter. (00:51:46:02 - 00:51:50:18)

Ryan: So while you know, the tools have improved and our materials, (00:51:50:21 - 00:51:55:09)

Ryan: the techniques are starting to come around. (00:51:56:03 - 00:51:58:07)

Ryan: And I feel (00:51:58:15 - 00:51:59:13)

Ryan: most of the trade education (00:52:00:19 - 00:52:02:22)

Ryan: in regards to framing is material (00:52:02:22 - 00:52:06:00)

Ryan: kind of related. (00:52:07:06 - 00:52:09:01)

Ryan: Hey, we have new sheathing out. (00:52:09:10 - 00:52:11:09)

Ryan: This is how we do it. (00:52:11:09 - 00:52:12:22)

Ryan: The techniques in which we use (00:52:12:22 - 00:52:16:00)

Ryan: to get a structure built have really not changed. (00:52:16:00 - 00:52:19:10)

Ryan: We have some we have nail guns now. (00:52:19:10 - 00:52:21:10)

Ryan: We, you know, we use air, we have battery powered guns, cordless saws. (00:52:21:10 - 00:52:25:04)

Ryan: All of that has come a long way. (00:52:25:12 - 00:52:27:15)

Ryan: And I feel like the education was focused towards that, more (00:52:27:15 - 00:52:31:23)

Ryan: so than how do we (00:52:31:23 - 00:52:34:13)

Ryan: actually do, (00:52:35:15 - 00:52:37:17)

Ryan: right? (00:52:37:18 - 00:52:38:07)

Ryan: So I learned on the job site, right, (00:52:38:07 - 00:52:41:06)

Ryan: late nineties, early, thousands making mistakes, getting yelled at. (00:52:41:21 - 00:52:45:10)

Ryan: You know, I always was afraid to let my my boss down (00:52:45:10 - 00:52:49:19)

Ryan: if he showed me that I did something poorly. (00:52:50:00 - 00:52:53:11)

Ryan: When he made that apparent, (00:52:53:15 - 00:52:54:22)

Ryan: it bothered me. (00:52:55:21 - 00:52:57:05)

Ryan: You know, I was like, it's like when you're a young boy and your (00:52:57:05 - 00:52:59:20)

Ryan: your father comes down on you and he yells that you feel bad. (00:52:59:20 - 00:53:02:20)

Ryan: That's how it was for me. (00:53:04:07 - 00:53:06:14)

Ryan: I always wanted to make my employer happy (00:53:06:17 - 00:53:09:09)

Ryan: and I wanted to be prideful in my work, and I figured that out pretty quickly. (00:53:09:09 - 00:53:14:13)

Ryan: So I kind of fell into place and moved my way up (00:53:14:13 - 00:53:19:09)

Ryan: through the ranks, just through old fashioned hard work. (00:53:19:21 - 00:53:22:20)

Ryan: So you don't have to. (00:53:23:13 - 00:53:26:09)

Ryan: Not everyone has to go to college. (00:53:26:13 - 00:53:28:15)

Ryan: We need mechanics. (00:53:28:15 - 00:53:29:18)

Ryan: We need carpenters and plumbers and AC guys (00:53:29:18 - 00:53:33:06)

Ryan: and electricians and concrete guys and arborists. (00:53:33:06 - 00:53:36:13)

Ryan: I mean, it's okay to work with your hands. (00:53:36:13 - 00:53:40:04)

Ryan: In fact, I find it extremely rewarding. (00:53:40:04 - 00:53:42:18)

Ryan: With that being said, a lot of jobs, you do have to go to college (00:53:43:16 - 00:53:47:13)

Ryan: because there's a lot there. (00:53:47:13 - 00:53:48:17)

Ryan: There's a lot to know. What we what we do is (00:53:48:17 - 00:53:50:18)

Ryan: much, much easier on many levels. (00:53:51:22 - 00:53:54:17)

Ryan: But it takes years to learn. (00:53:55:18 - 00:53:57:16)

Ryan: It does and to teach and share in that (00:53:57:16 - 00:54:00:15)

Ryan: hopefully will give the younger generations (00:54:01:17 - 00:54:04:22)

Ryan: coming up, you know, a jumpstart. (00:54:05:03 - 00:54:08:02)

Ryan: Right. (00:54:08:02 - 00:54:08:18)

Ryan: I mean, my my oldest son, he just turned 14. (00:54:09:08 - 00:54:12:22)

Ryan: He loves coming to work with dad. (00:54:12:22 - 00:54:14:20)

Ryan: You know, he likes to have a little money in his pocket. (00:54:14:20 - 00:54:16:15)

Ryan: He's interested. (00:54:16:15 - 00:54:17:10)

Ryan: He's that similar type of mind that I have, (00:54:17:10 - 00:54:21:00)

Ryan: and I'm not going to push him to go to college. (00:54:21:11 - 00:54:23:17)

Ryan: I tell him, you do what you want to do. (00:54:24:04 - 00:54:26:16)

Ryan: If you want to, you want to go that route, that's fine if you want to. (00:54:27:05 - 00:54:30:01)

Ryan: You know, I'm not going to say I want a different life for you. (00:54:30:18 - 00:54:34:13)

Ryan: Obviously, I want the best of everything for my children. (00:54:35:04 - 00:54:38:14)

Ryan: But I also know how rewarding (00:54:38:14 - 00:54:40:17)

Ryan: it's been for me, despite the challenges and the hard times. (00:54:40:17 - 00:54:44:05)

Ryan: That's okay because life always easy. (00:54:44:10 - 00:54:47:13)

Ryan: And to simply make decisions based on (00:54:48:07 - 00:54:51:00)

Ryan: how easy it will make your life (00:54:52:08 - 00:54:55:05)

Ryan: to me is a total wrong approach. (00:54:55:05 - 00:54:57:07)

Ryan: I say, as I mentioned before, do what you like to do. (00:54:57:07 - 00:55:00:06)

Ryan: Hey, if you enjoy this, you know, whatever that may be, (00:55:00:21 - 00:55:03:17)

Ryan: but you can go over here and do this and make a little bit more money. (00:55:04:13 - 00:55:08:01)

Ryan: That, to me, that's (00:55:09:00 - 00:55:10:20)

Ryan: that's a no brainer. (00:55:11:07 - 00:55:12:06)

Ryan: Do what you love, you know, to be a happier person. (00:55:12:06 - 00:55:17:02)

Ryan: And that's my approach with what these younger guys we have some on our cruise (00:55:17:02 - 00:55:21:04)

Ryan: now. I try to infect them (00:55:21:04 - 00:55:23:20)

Ryan: with the passion and feeling it gives me to be there. (00:55:24:05 - 00:55:28:11)

Ryan: You know, they've been on the job site for two weeks without me. (00:55:28:11 - 00:55:31:23)

Ryan: Here comes the rafters. They show up, right? (00:55:32:20 - 00:55:34:18)

Ryan: Oh, Ryan's here. My tool belt. (00:55:34:18 - 00:55:36:03)

Ryan: And here we go, you know. Hey, how you doing? (00:55:36:03 - 00:55:38:17)

Ryan: Hi. I'm saying hello to everybody. (00:55:38:17 - 00:55:40:11)

Ryan: I try to grab those, you know, younger the older teens and the younger twenties (00:55:40:11 - 00:55:45:05)

Ryan: and sit with them on launch and, you know, try to make them think that roof (00:55:45:05 - 00:55:50:08)

Ryan: framing is the absolute most amazing thing in the world, (00:55:50:13 - 00:55:53:13)

Ryan: because I want to, in fact, them with that. (00:55:53:13 - 00:55:56:08)

Ryan: I want them to stay. (00:55:56:15 - 00:55:57:19)

Ryan: Hey, we need to help be there, a certain type of person to still be here. (00:55:57:19 - 00:56:02:00)

Ryan: So I want them to look at a man my age and say, (00:56:02:14 - 00:56:06:11)

Ryan: wow, he really still likes this. (00:56:07:12 - 00:56:09:08)

Ryan: He loves it like either this guy is cuckoo or maybe I've made the right decision. (00:56:09:08 - 00:56:14:21)

Ryan: Maybe I'll see it through. (00:56:14:21 - 00:56:15:20)

Ryan: Maybe I'll stick with this. (00:56:15:20 - 00:56:17:01)

Ryan: You know, he seems to enjoy it. (00:56:17:01 - 00:56:18:20)

Ryan: He seems happy. (00:56:18:20 - 00:56:20:03)

Ryan: So I think that's all with the teaching and the (00:56:20:03 - 00:56:22:15)

Ryan: in the sharing, you know, like we're doing here, (00:56:23:05 - 00:56:25:18)

Ryan: I think that is the future. (00:56:27:05 - 00:56:29:04)

Ryan: I really do. (00:56:29:04 - 00:56:30:01)

Ryan: And the trades need it more than ever. (00:56:30:01 - 00:56:32:06)

Ryan: They really do. (00:56:33:00 - 00:56:35:21)

Ryan: I think a key point that you kind of alluded to as well is that (00:56:35:21 - 00:56:38:18)

Ryan: an individual's intelligence is not (00:56:39:20 - 00:56:42:05)

Ryan: measured by acknowledges degrees. (00:56:42:05 - 00:56:44:23)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:56:45:07 - 00:56:45:21)

Ryan: Like I don't know, I'm racking my brain all week to see if I, (00:56:45:21 - 00:56:48:15)

Ryan: you know, anybody who could (00:56:48:20 - 00:56:51:17)

Ryan: calculate and care to the degree that you do. (00:56:51:17 - 00:56:54:15)

Ryan: Yeah. (00:56:55:13 - 00:56:56:01)

Ryan: So mean you guys have made that evident to me as well. (00:56:56:01 - 00:56:59:09)

Ryan: That's back to the appreciation of what others do. (00:57:00:07 - 00:57:02:23)

Ryan: I mean, people are amazing, but (00:57:02:23 - 00:57:06:11)

Ryan: when I graduated high school in 1999, (00:57:07:23 - 00:57:11:01)

Ryan: you know, they had career day and all these career fairs, (00:57:11:06 - 00:57:14:01)

Ryan: there wasn't a bricklayer there or an electrician (00:57:14:08 - 00:57:17:12)

Ryan: or a framing carpenter, probably because they just couldn't leave the job. (00:57:17:12 - 00:57:21:13)

Ryan: Right. (00:57:21:13 - 00:57:22:01)

Ryan: There's always a lot of work. There's so much work to do all the time. (00:57:22:01 - 00:57:24:19)

Ryan: But it almost felt like (00:57:24:19 - 00:57:27:11)

Ryan: if I didn't go to college, (00:57:28:15 - 00:57:31:08)

Ryan: I would be not received the same or maybe even looked down upon. (00:57:31:08 - 00:57:35:23)

Ryan: And that's a tough stigma. (00:57:36:10 - 00:57:38:11)

Ryan: You know, (00:57:38:11 - 00:57:39:13)

Ryan: I don't appreciate (00:57:40:08 - 00:57:42:02)

Ryan: the phrase I work in construction. (00:57:42:02 - 00:57:45:04)

Ryan: I think that's too generalized. (00:57:45:10 - 00:57:47:03)

Ryan: When I hear that, I'll say, Oh, what do you do? (00:57:47:03 - 00:57:49:17)

Ryan: Well, you know, I'm a mason. (00:57:49:17 - 00:57:51:03)

Ryan: I said, Well, you don't work in construction. (00:57:51:03 - 00:57:53:05)

Ryan: You're an artist, right? (00:57:53:05 - 00:57:54:19)

Ryan: That's some of my I told you earlier this week some some of my favorite lunch (00:57:54:19 - 00:57:58:23)

Ryan: breaks are where there's a crew of Masons in the line of sight for me. (00:57:58:23 - 00:58:02:19)

Ryan: And can eat my lunch and watch them lay bricks or stack stones. (00:58:02:19 - 00:58:07:10)

Ryan: It's just fascinating to me. (00:58:07:10 - 00:58:09:11)

Ryan: And then I'll go over, maybe even introduce myself, say hello. (00:58:09:20 - 00:58:13:07)

Ryan: Sometimes I'll eat lunch with them (00:58:13:07 - 00:58:15:07)

Ryan: or I'll wait till they leave and I'll go over and look at their work. (00:58:15:07 - 00:58:17:23)

Ryan: And it's you know, I have a deep appreciation for the trades because work in them. (00:58:17:23 - 00:58:23:07)

Ryan: You guys have given me (00:58:24:10 - 00:58:27:19)

Ryan: so much. (00:58:27:21 - 00:58:29:12)

Ryan: It's been it's been humbling to see what (00:58:29:12 - 00:58:31:19)

Ryan: took place here this week and the thought processes. (00:58:31:19 - 00:58:35:01)

Ryan: And as you said, you can tell that I care about what I do (00:58:35:12 - 00:58:40:01)

Ryan: and I feel the same exact way about you guys. (00:58:40:01 - 00:58:43:11)

Ryan: It's been you all seem to enjoy it. (00:58:43:11 - 00:58:45:22)

Ryan: Happy every day you're creating (00:58:46:11 - 00:58:48:16)

Ryan: educational videos that are going to make (00:58:50:15 - 00:58:53:04)

Ryan: an absolute necessity. (00:58:55:14 - 00:58:56:23)

Ryan: As we stated, human shelter. Right? (00:58:56:23 - 00:58:59:21)

Ryan: It's going to bring it more to light (00:58:59:21 - 00:59:02:08)

Ryan: and hopefully bring more people in because we need that (00:59:02:08 - 00:59:05:21)

Ryan: and hopefully that continues to happen. (00:59:07:06 - 00:59:11:04)

Ryan: What does it. (00:59:11:04 - 00:59:11:21)

Ryan: Take to be a good student? (00:59:11:21 - 00:59:16:09)

Ryan: To be a good student (00:59:16:09 - 00:59:18:19)

Ryan: for me is all about attitude. (00:59:18:20 - 00:59:21:17)

Ryan: It's not, you know, I don't need you to show me how smart you are. (00:59:22:20 - 00:59:28:21)

Ryan: I need you to show me that you're eager to learn. (00:59:28:21 - 00:59:31:11)

Ryan: You're listening. (00:59:32:05 - 00:59:33:02)

Ryan: You have to be a good listener and you have to be really good (00:59:33:02 - 00:59:36:12)

Ryan: at making mistakes. (00:59:36:12 - 00:59:37:13)

Ryan: Meaning, if you don't make any mistakes, (00:59:37:13 - 00:59:40:02)

Ryan: I'm going to start wondering why we're even in front of each other. (00:59:40:13 - 00:59:44:15)

Ryan: Right? So (00:59:44:15 - 00:59:45:09)

Ryan: to ask questions (00:59:46:13 - 00:59:49:02)

Ryan: and then I like to see the lights go off. (00:59:49:02 - 00:59:52:03)

Ryan: And it's happened several times for me, (00:59:52:03 - 00:59:54:03)

Ryan: being a good student, (00:59:56:07 - 00:59:58:21)

Ryan: I think you just need to have the right amount of interest, right? (00:59:58:23 - 01:00:02:15)

Ryan: It's hard for me to learn about something that's not interesting. (01:00:02:15 - 01:00:05:09)

Ryan: If I'm interested in something and I read about it (01:00:06:00 - 01:00:09:13)

Ryan: or I listen to someone talk about it, (01:00:09:13 - 01:00:11:14)

Ryan: I'll take a certain level of knowledge away. (01:00:12:22 - 01:00:17:10)

Ryan: If I'm sitting in something that's boring to me, you know, (01:00:17:18 - 01:00:21:22)

Ryan: I won't remember as much. (01:00:23:05 - 01:00:24:11)

Ryan: So I think, I think to be a really good student, you have to be interested (01:00:24:11 - 01:00:28:18)

Ryan: A, B, you have to have a good attitude, meaning you have to be positive. (01:00:28:18 - 01:00:34:02)

Ryan: You have to be able to receive criticism, constructive criticism. (01:00:34:02 - 01:00:38:09)

Ryan: You kind of have to leave your feelings out of it. (01:00:40:09 - 01:00:42:10)

Ryan: Or maybe old habits is, if I'm responsible for teaching you, I want you. (01:00:42:10 - 01:00:48:07)

Ryan: I'm inviting you to try and think along with me. (01:00:49:03 - 01:00:52:01)

Ryan: Now there's 100 other ways to do exactly what I do, but I want to show you my way. (01:00:52:11 - 01:00:58:04)

Ryan: I want you to absorb that. (01:00:58:05 - 01:01:00:01)

Ryan: And then I'm willing to have the conversation of, Hey, (01:01:00:01 - 01:01:03:13)

Ryan: well, we can try it like this or like that. (01:01:03:13 - 01:01:05:14)

Ryan: And through that could come personal growth (01:01:05:18 - 01:01:08:01)

Ryan: for both the teacher and the student, (01:01:08:01 - 01:01:10:08)

Ryan: because it's not certainly my way or the highway, right? (01:01:10:08 - 01:01:14:02)

Ryan: There's always things to learn, which I mentioned earlier. (01:01:14:02 - 01:01:17:08)

Ryan: I'm still learning every day. (01:01:17:08 - 01:01:19:14)

Ryan: So that's a big point to me. (01:01:19:14 - 01:01:21:05)

Ryan: Be available. (01:01:21:05 - 01:01:22:19)

Ryan: Listen, have a good attitude and you have to have interest and (01:01:22:19 - 01:01:27:22)

Ryan: you have to spend the time. (01:01:29:16 - 01:01:31:18)

Ryan: That's the biggest thing. (01:01:31:18 - 01:01:33:13)

Ryan: When all is said and done and say your lesson is done for the day (01:01:33:13 - 01:01:38:22)

Ryan: or what have you, and you're back home is to keep it going. (01:01:38:22 - 01:01:42:11)

Ryan: Keep thinking about it, keep studying it, keep practicing it. (01:01:43:02 - 01:01:46:15)

Ryan: That's that's what I did for many years in my garage, you know, at night. (01:01:46:15 - 01:01:51:04)

Ryan: So there's got to be a hunger there to be a good student, in my mind. (01:01:51:04 - 01:01:55:15)

Ryan: At least that's for me. (01:01:55:15 - 01:01:58:05)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:01:58:08 - 01:01:58:22)

Ryan: I mean, it's, it's, you know, I mean, at least you embody it. (01:01:59:11 - 01:02:01:21)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:02:01:21 - 01:02:02:23)

Ryan: Yeah, I appreciate that. (01:02:03:00 - 01:02:06:00)

Ryan: And I check my notes real quick here. (01:02:06:00 - 01:02:07:05)

Ryan: Right. (01:02:07:05 - 01:02:07:13)

Ryan: But, but also I have done it. (01:02:07:13 - 01:02:10:22)

Ryan: That's on your mind. (01:02:11:03 - 01:02:12:09)

Ryan: Kind of upside (01:02:16:00 - 01:02:17:00)

Ryan: down. (01:02:17:00 - 01:02:23:20)

Ryan: That's my boss falling asleep. (01:02:23:20 - 01:02:26:01)

Ryan: Yeah, yeah. (01:02:26:01 - 01:02:44:14)

Ryan: I got a couple more (01:02:44:14 - 01:02:45:15)

Ryan: cameras. (01:02:49:11 - 01:02:49:19)

Ryan: All good. (01:02:49:19 - 01:02:50:03)

Ryan: Rolling, rolling. (01:02:50:03 - 01:02:53:03)

Ryan: Joey's upside down. (01:02:53:03 - 01:02:54:22)

Ryan: Now. That's all right. I can talk to you upside down. (01:02:54:22 - 01:02:57:01)

Ryan: You know what I mean? (01:02:57:01 - 01:02:59:17)

Ryan: Like you said, you get it. But, yeah. (01:02:59:17 - 01:03:01:22)

Ryan: You know what I look like from every angle, probably. (01:03:01:22 - 01:03:04:07)

Ryan: Oh, yeah, yeah. (01:03:04:07 - 01:03:08:19)

Ryan: Look good, bro. Like T-shirts, man. (01:03:08:19 - 01:03:12:04)

Ryan: They're thinning. (01:03:12:04 - 01:03:14:21)

Ryan: Oh, man. Um, (01:03:14:21 - 01:03:17:22)

Ryan: cool. (01:03:19:00 - 01:03:19:10)

Ryan: Everybody get set. Go. (01:03:19:10 - 01:03:28:13)

Ryan: What? (01:03:28:13 - 01:03:31:11)

Ryan: What's your biggest hope in? (01:03:31:11 - 01:03:35:03)

Ryan: What do you hope that today's carpenters take away from what? (01:03:35:03 - 01:03:38:05)

Ryan: We've just been learning about it with that group? (01:03:38:05 - 01:03:43:11)

Ryan: I think the biggest thing, (01:03:43:11 - 01:03:46:06)

Ryan: my biggest hope for what (01:03:46:12 - 01:03:48:15)

Ryan: a future student may take away from (01:03:49:23 - 01:03:51:17)

Ryan: this is not even necessarily learning (01:03:51:17 - 01:03:55:11)

Ryan: and being better at what they do, (01:03:56:03 - 01:03:58:19)

Ryan: as much as being passionate about what they do. (01:03:58:20 - 01:04:02:17)

Ryan: A particularly (01:04:03:19 - 01:04:05:20)

Ryan: shitty car. (01:04:05:20 - 01:04:10:04)

Ryan: Okay, but we're right. (01:04:10:04 - 01:04:11:21)

Ryan: Thank you. (01:04:11:21 - 01:04:13:23)

Ryan: My biggest hope for the students that may take this is (01:04:13:23 - 01:04:17:21)

Ryan: for obvious reasons, the education and getting better. (01:04:19:14 - 01:04:21:22)

Ryan: But more importantly would be to (01:04:21:22 - 01:04:24:04)

Ryan: maybe be more passionate, maybe (01:04:25:10 - 01:04:28:11)

Ryan: feel what I've shared for themselves, because I think it takes a level (01:04:29:12 - 01:04:34:23)

Ryan: of passion and intensity to get better at things. (01:04:34:23 - 01:04:39:04)

Ryan: Right? (01:04:39:04 - 01:04:39:17)

Ryan: I mean, practice makes perfect, as they say. (01:04:39:19 - 01:04:43:05)

Ryan: To have a level of passion about something makes the practice easier, right? (01:04:43:05 - 01:04:48:04)

Ryan: You're not so afraid when when you make mistakes (01:04:48:04 - 01:04:50:20)

Ryan: or when it takes you longer to understand something, (01:04:51:05 - 01:04:54:06)

Ryan: you're still hungry for it because you're because of the passion. (01:04:54:13 - 01:04:57:17)

Ryan: So it kind of keeps you motivated. (01:04:57:17 - 01:05:00:04)

Ryan: It's sort of the the gas in the tank for me. (01:05:00:16 - 01:05:03:06)

Ryan: You know, when I have I have difficult days sometimes (01:05:04:02 - 01:05:07:02)

Ryan: for whatever reason was a long week with with my children or my family and (01:05:07:02 - 01:05:11:11)

Ryan: I got a lot of things going on outside of work. (01:05:12:02 - 01:05:14:20)

Ryan: And when I come to do what I do, it's (01:05:14:20 - 01:05:17:22)

Ryan: a lot easier for me to push all that away and focus on (01:05:17:22 - 01:05:21:23)

Ryan: what I'm doing because I genuinely enjoy it. (01:05:21:23 - 01:05:25:06)

Ryan: So more importantly, I hope that I've conveyed that (01:05:26:03 - 01:05:30:06)

Ryan: through our lessons. (01:05:31:05 - 01:05:32:16)

Ryan: I do want them to understand and learn. (01:05:32:16 - 01:05:35:10)

Ryan: It would be really cool to see a whole bunch of companies (01:05:36:03 - 01:05:40:04)

Ryan: out there pretty cutting roofs that would be like the ultimate honor. (01:05:40:04 - 01:05:44:13)

Ryan: It would be mind bending. (01:05:44:13 - 01:05:46:12)

Ryan: And I'm confident that, (01:05:46:12 - 01:05:48:15)

Ryan: you know, with the techniques that I've shown, that that's (01:05:48:22 - 01:05:52:15)

Ryan: probably not so far out of reach for a lot of guys that are very close. (01:05:52:15 - 01:05:56:05)

Ryan: And for those that are kind of new to this, (01:05:56:12 - 01:05:58:14)

Ryan: well, you're going to have a leg up on me because this took many years (01:05:59:19 - 01:06:03:01)

Ryan: to figure out. (01:06:03:01 - 01:06:03:19)

Ryan: So for me to share that is, again, an honor. (01:06:03:19 - 01:06:06:21)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:06:08:04 - 01:06:10:21)

Ryan: Another thing I feel like I've learned this week is like, (01:06:10:21 - 01:06:13:00)

Ryan: I mean, you build the roof up here. (01:06:13:01 - 01:06:15:10)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:06:15:10 - 01:06:15:18)

Ryan: I mean, cutting was cool to see, but, like, (01:06:15:18 - 01:06:18:05)

Ryan: I feel like we watched you build a roof, you know, in your mind. (01:06:18:05 - 01:06:20:19)

Ryan: Oh, yeah. (01:06:20:22 - 01:06:21:21)

Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. The roof. (01:06:22:00 - 01:06:24:15)

Ryan: It's always there. It's always in your head. (01:06:24:15 - 01:06:27:07)

Ryan: Speaking from a roof color, uh, standpoint, that's (01:06:27:07 - 01:06:30:16)

Ryan: I, I think we're maybe (01:06:32:04 - 01:06:33:13)

Ryan: I don't want to use the term a rare breed or a dying breed, (01:06:33:13 - 01:06:36:13)

Ryan: but I think there's some value and some truth to that. (01:06:36:13 - 01:06:38:23)

Ryan: Now, it's not interesting to everybody. (01:06:39:03 - 01:06:41:06)

Ryan: So framing carpenters generally that I that I know in my personal life (01:06:41:06 - 01:06:46:06)

Ryan: and have seen on social media platforms, everybody enjoys the roof. (01:06:46:06 - 01:06:52:01)

Ryan: That's the only part that's different. (01:06:52:08 - 01:06:53:21)

Ryan: So yeah, you build it. (01:06:53:21 - 01:06:56:11)

Ryan: You build it first few times, quite a few times. (01:06:56:21 - 01:07:01:09)

Ryan: It's always there. (01:07:01:09 - 01:07:02:19)

Ryan: Um, and then the next drawing comes in (01:07:02:19 - 01:07:06:01)

Ryan: and that roof you just finished, kind of it doesn't go away. (01:07:06:01 - 01:07:10:01)

Ryan: It still creeps back in. (01:07:10:02 - 01:07:11:20)

Ryan: You'll notice similarities with the next house. (01:07:11:20 - 01:07:15:18)

Ryan: Certain numbers will jump out and you'll say, Hey, that was (01:07:16:01 - 01:07:18:10)

Ryan: that was the same span from two roofs ago or the last roof. (01:07:18:17 - 01:07:22:03)

Ryan: So it's kind of always lingering. (01:07:22:03 - 01:07:24:05)

Ryan: And it seems like the file cabinet will hold several, three (01:07:24:05 - 01:07:28:00)

Ryan: or four roofs at a time some mornings I'll come in. I (01:07:28:00 - 01:07:32:05)

Ryan: finally got a hold and then I morning. (01:07:33:15 - 01:07:35:22)

Ryan: Some mornings I'll come in to the shop during the cutting phase (01:07:36:12 - 01:07:40:21)

Ryan: and I'll set up my gauges on my square to a pitch from two or three roofs ago. (01:07:41:06 - 01:07:46:17)

Ryan: It's just still in my mind, you know. (01:07:46:17 - 01:07:49:06)

Ryan: So a lot of little things like that. (01:07:49:06 - 01:07:51:11)

Ryan: I always chuckle at myself. (01:07:52:22 - 01:07:54:23)

Ryan: I'll remember a certain dimension for weeks. (01:07:55:08 - 01:07:58:23)

Ryan: We'll be eating dinner at home, thinking about, you know, 33 foot (01:07:59:04 - 01:08:03:05)

Ryan: five and 5/8, because that was a span that was so important to me (01:08:03:05 - 01:08:07:16)

Ryan: that we got right because it affected so many other parts (01:08:08:11 - 01:08:11:07)

Ryan: that it just kind of burned into my brain for, you know, a small time. (01:08:11:07 - 01:08:15:09)

Ryan: But yeah, it's definitely very, very mental (01:08:15:09 - 01:08:21:09)

Ryan: sort of a profession or task. (01:08:21:18 - 01:08:25:04)

Ryan: What does that breakdown like that? (01:08:25:17 - 01:08:26:23)

Ryan: Like how how much mental, how much physical. (01:08:26:23 - 01:08:29:10)

Ryan: What Well, it's both. Yes, it's (01:08:29:10 - 01:08:31:12)

Ryan: it's very I don't want to use (01:08:32:12 - 01:08:34:04)

Ryan: the term taxing because I enjoy it, but it is it's stressful, right? (01:08:34:04 - 01:08:37:23)

Ryan: I mean, the stakes are high you've you have (01:08:37:23 - 01:08:41:04)

Ryan: thousands of dollars of material (01:08:42:10 - 01:08:44:13)

Ryan: that you're responsible for cutting (01:08:45:10 - 01:08:47:18)

Ryan: and that brings its own level of stress. (01:08:47:18 - 01:08:51:09)

Ryan: However, at this point, you have a level of confidence (01:08:51:09 - 01:08:56:00)

Ryan: that it's going to work. (01:08:56:13 - 01:08:59:14)

Ryan: You've done it time and time again. (01:08:59:14 - 01:09:01:19)

Ryan: However, with that being said, I'm never comfortable. (01:09:01:19 - 01:09:04:08)

Ryan: Always (01:09:05:05 - 01:09:06:10)

Ryan: I'm comfortable in my (01:09:07:04 - 01:09:09:16)

Ryan: SO then it becomes monitoring myself. (01:09:09:16 - 01:09:12:02)

Ryan: And how focused are you? (01:09:12:02 - 01:09:15:00)

Ryan: For example, (01:09:15:00 - 01:09:16:16)

Ryan: as I mentioned earlier, when I'm in the calculating process, (01:09:17:14 - 01:09:20:21)

Ryan: I'll sit at this drawing table for hours, several days. (01:09:21:09 - 01:09:24:17)

Ryan: Sometimes I will find myself drifting out of what I'm doing. (01:09:24:17 - 01:09:29:08)

Ryan: I'm doing it, I'm hitting my calculator, I'm filling up my notebook, (01:09:29:08 - 01:09:32:17)

Ryan: and I'll be thinking about something else. (01:09:32:17 - 01:09:35:12)

Ryan: I have to get up. (01:09:36:08 - 01:09:37:05)

Ryan: I'll pace around the shop for 20 minutes. (01:09:37:05 - 01:09:39:09)

Ryan: I'll go outside some fresh air. (01:09:39:23 - 01:09:42:04)

Ryan: Sit down for a minute, then I'll come back to it. (01:09:42:04 - 01:09:44:14)

Ryan: I'll double check what I was working on. (01:09:45:15 - 01:09:47:21)

Ryan: Sometimes I find mistakes and I say, (01:09:47:21 - 01:09:50:00)

Ryan: Well, boy, I'm glad that you, you know, you took a break because I would have (01:09:50:00 - 01:09:53:11)

Ryan: I would have been bad guys want to let you live that down. (01:09:53:12 - 01:09:56:02)

Ryan: The mistakes are never huge (01:09:56:10 - 01:10:00:01)

Ryan: because of the way I've laid this system out. (01:10:00:01 - 01:10:03:03)

Ryan: It's hard to not catch them. (01:10:03:03 - 01:10:05:07)

Ryan: You know, that's from day one, going out to the job, transferring (01:10:05:07 - 01:10:08:21)

Ryan: the marks over to the blueprints, handing that over to the crew. (01:10:08:21 - 01:10:12:14)

Ryan: All of those things ensure it's a double (01:10:12:20 - 01:10:15:15)

Ryan: check, triple check the whole way. So (01:10:15:15 - 01:10:17:23)

Ryan: but it's very stressful, (01:10:19:01 - 01:10:21:03)

Ryan: but it's a good stress because it's fun. (01:10:21:21 - 01:10:24:00)

Ryan: So and I think people by nature (01:10:24:22 - 01:10:27:17)

Ryan: always perform better under pressure that it's easy. (01:10:28:11 - 01:10:31:21)

Ryan: You don't try as hard right if you get up to the plate and you know (01:10:31:21 - 01:10:34:23)

Ryan: you're going to hit a homerun every time, how boring would that be? (01:10:34:23 - 01:10:37:23)

Ryan: Would be boring. (01:10:39:05 - 01:10:40:08)

Ryan: So that that stress is okay. (01:10:40:08 - 01:10:42:23)

Ryan: And I like kind of having a fire underneath me. (01:10:42:23 - 01:10:45:12)

Ryan: He keeps me, keeps me sharp. (01:10:45:13 - 01:10:50:15)

Ryan: That I mean, that's a great I mean, you almost answer my next question (01:10:50:15 - 01:10:53:05)

Ryan: are you did answering my next question, which is basically like, (01:10:53:05 - 01:10:55:17)

Ryan: you know, like I just think of like this as being like a very, (01:10:56:07 - 01:10:59:18)

Ryan: very pressure ful situation, you know, like roofing, a lot of pressure. (01:10:59:18 - 01:11:04:15)

Ryan: I mean, there's a lot of money. There's a lot at stake. (01:11:04:19 - 01:11:07:02)

Ryan: Like you said, um, it's got to work and it's got to fit. (01:11:07:02 - 01:11:11:01)

Ryan: And so, like, my question would be like, how do you handle that pressure? (01:11:11:11 - 01:11:14:19)

Ryan: And I think it's, you know, (01:11:14:19 - 01:11:16:11)

Ryan: certainly the methodology (01:11:16:11 - 01:11:17:13)

Ryan: that yeah, it's almost like you've learned to rely on yourself (01:11:17:13 - 01:11:20:10)

Ryan: and you have to rely on the math and your experience. (01:11:20:16 - 01:11:24:14)

Ryan: So I'm wondering if you can (01:11:24:14 - 01:11:26:02)

Ryan: just talk about like how you handle (01:11:27:02 - 01:11:28:19)

Ryan: pressure, how you handle that stress. (01:11:28:19 - 01:11:32:14)

Ryan: So yeah, (01:11:32:14 - 01:11:34:02)

Ryan: there is a lot at stake and the pressures are (01:11:34:22 - 01:11:37:05)

Ryan: a lot. (01:11:37:21 - 01:11:40:15)

Ryan: It's not always easy. (01:11:40:15 - 01:11:42:17)

Ryan: Sometimes that puts me in. (01:11:42:17 - 01:11:45:02)

Ryan: I don't want to say a bad mood, but I'm a human. (01:11:46:12 - 01:11:48:13)

Ryan: A bad mood, right? (01:11:48:13 - 01:11:49:17)

Ryan: I come home after a long day and or the weather was bad or for what I or I. (01:11:49:17 - 01:11:53:23)

Ryan: I made a big mistake. (01:11:54:04 - 01:11:55:09)

Ryan: And I'm my own worst critic, so (01:11:55:09 - 01:11:58:13)

Ryan: it's not always easy. But (01:12:00:01 - 01:12:02:18)

Ryan: as interesting as it may sound, (01:12:02:18 - 01:12:05:16)

Ryan: it's kind of a self-reliant, (01:12:05:16 - 01:12:07:17)

Ryan: self-soothing, sort of coping mechanism. (01:12:07:17 - 01:12:10:17)

Ryan: I feel most comfortable when my tool belt is on, (01:12:11:03 - 01:12:14:18)

Ryan: when I'm staring at a roof plan or I have a sore on my hands SO (01:12:15:05 - 01:12:19:18)

Ryan: I may carry those stresses home with me for one night. (01:12:21:15 - 01:12:24:20)

Ryan: But the very next morning when I have the radio going (01:12:25:00 - 01:12:28:08)

Ryan: and I'm cutting or whatever it is, it just kind of all goes away. (01:12:28:08 - 01:12:32:09)

Ryan: And I fall right back into that feeling of (01:12:33:02 - 01:12:35:20)

Ryan: of passion and, you know, that drive to (01:12:36:09 - 01:12:40:15)

Ryan: to really push yourself and (01:12:41:16 - 01:12:44:20)

Ryan: handling stress is different for everyone. (01:12:45:12 - 01:12:51:11)

Ryan: My kids keep me pretty busy, so I don't really I don't have a lot of time (01:12:51:11 - 01:12:55:04)

Ryan: to feel stress when I live here, so (01:12:55:04 - 01:12:57:22)

Ryan: I kind of handle it and burn it off at the same time. (01:12:58:16 - 01:13:01:06)

Ryan: As I said, if I, if I, if I notice I've miscalculated something (01:13:01:22 - 01:13:06:18)

Ryan: and I didn't catch it for like a whole section of roof. (01:13:06:18 - 01:13:10:04)

Ryan: And there it is. (01:13:10:04 - 01:13:10:20)

Ryan: It shows up and I'm like, Wait a minute, that should be this. Or (01:13:10:20 - 01:13:13:12)

Ryan: I'll get (01:13:14:20 - 01:13:15:05)

Ryan: up and I'll pace around and I'm like, That's a bummer. (01:13:15:05 - 01:13:18:02)

Ryan: I'll have to use an eraser, you know, big deal. (01:13:18:07 - 01:13:21:07)

Ryan: It's not like everything's cut at that point. (01:13:21:07 - 01:13:23:08)

Ryan: So the stress is kind of gone after (01:13:23:13 - 01:13:27:14)

Ryan: I've began cutting because I have double, triple checked everything. (01:13:27:14 - 01:13:31:00)

Ryan: Now I'll make I'll make human errors during the cutting. (01:13:31:15 - 01:13:35:07)

Ryan: I'll, I'll cut the wrong bevel or I'll cut it backwards, things like that. (01:13:35:07 - 01:13:40:05)

Ryan: That's always going to happen. (01:13:40:05 - 01:13:41:09)

Ryan: I mean, there's hundreds of rafters on every house. (01:13:41:09 - 01:13:44:21)

Ryan: And I think, as I mentioned in one of my courses, (01:13:44:21 - 01:13:48:17)

Ryan: I've never got 100% on a roof, (01:13:48:17 - 01:13:51:20)

Ryan: a lot of nineties, upper nineties, but I have never aced one, so to say. (01:13:52:13 - 01:13:56:15)

Ryan: And I like that because as said, how how boring would that be (01:13:56:23 - 01:14:02:09)

Ryan: if every time it was just perfect it wouldn't be any fun, you know? (01:14:02:09 - 01:14:07:02)

Ryan: And every time I cut a roof I leave the shop, I turn the light off. (01:14:07:04 - 01:14:11:16)

Ryan: I know tomorrow we're delivering it. (01:14:11:16 - 01:14:13:14)

Ryan: I think I got 100. (01:14:13:14 - 01:14:15:17)

Ryan: So then I get excited and eager and we started putting the roof together (01:14:15:17 - 01:14:19:14)

Ryan: and we've gotten them together down to like the last 20 rafters. (01:14:19:17 - 01:14:23:19)

Ryan: And sure enough, (01:14:24:04 - 01:14:25:08)

Ryan: hey, you got the bubbles backwards on these three jacks, right now. (01:14:25:08 - 01:14:29:15)

Ryan: See, I just can't get one right, (01:14:29:20 - 01:14:31:06)

Ryan: but it's an easy (01:14:32:11 - 01:14:33:05)

Ryan: fix, you know, we just switch the bubbles. And (01:14:33:05 - 01:14:36:03)

Ryan: so, yeah, it's (01:14:37:06 - 01:14:39:10)

Ryan: if you follow the system that I've they've shared (01:14:40:04 - 01:14:43:07)

Ryan: the stress. (01:14:44:18 - 01:14:46:10)

Ryan: The stress will be there the whole time. (01:14:46:10 - 01:14:47:23)

Ryan: But The more you understand it, the more efficient (01:14:47:23 - 01:14:50:07)

Ryan: you're going to be at it. (01:14:50:07 - 01:14:51:00)

Ryan: And I'm telling you, I make mistakes, okay? (01:14:51:00 - 01:14:54:19)

Ryan: We just have to be (01:14:55:03 - 01:14:57:10)

Ryan: concise about what we're doing. (01:14:57:18 - 01:14:59:07)

Ryan: We have to be focused, okay? (01:14:59:07 - 01:15:02:02)

Ryan: You can't you can't be somewhere else mentally. (01:15:03:02 - 01:15:05:17)

Ryan: You have to be ready to sit down and focus on what you're doing. (01:15:06:14 - 01:15:09:10)

Ryan: I think so. (01:15:10:04 - 01:15:12:13)

Ryan: I guess the long answer, short answer of all that is (01:15:12:13 - 01:15:15:10)

Ryan: I handle my stress with stress, if that makes sense. (01:15:15:10 - 01:15:18:23)

Ryan: It stresses me out to be stressed out. (01:15:19:16 - 01:15:21:19)

Ryan: So I go to work and I feel better. (01:15:21:19 - 01:15:24:13)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:15:25:06 - 01:15:25:13)

Ryan: I mean, you plan, your plan or do. (01:15:26:18 - 01:15:28:15)

Ryan: I play a guitar? (01:15:28:15 - 01:15:29:17)

Ryan: That's what I should have said if I. (01:15:29:17 - 01:15:31:15)

Ryan: What I heard here was if you're stressed at work, have kids. (01:15:31:15 - 01:15:34:15)

Ryan: Yeah, yes, have kids. (01:15:35:00 - 01:15:38:12)

Ryan: The more the merrier. I love kids. (01:15:38:14 - 01:15:40:17)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:15:40:23 - 01:15:41:09)

Ryan: Most important part of my life. (01:15:41:09 - 01:15:45:23)

Ryan: Yeah. (01:15:45:23 - 01:15:46:04)

Ryan: Stress is, you know, that's different for everyone. (01:15:46:04 - 01:15:49:04)

Ryan: So that's a that's a tough one to answer. (01:15:49:04 - 01:15:51:10)

Ryan: I'd like to tell you, I you know, I'll just I'll go home (01:15:51:10 - 01:15:54:03)

Ryan: and I'll crush a 30 pack of beer and I feel way better. (01:15:54:03 - 01:15:59:12)

Ryan: Yeah, right. (01:15:59:12 - 01:16:02:17)

Ryan: So cool. (01:16:02:17 - 01:16:05:06)

Ryan: Yeah, I've got I've got one, one kind of last question in my head (01:16:05:06 - 01:16:08:02)

Ryan: and feel free to riff on anything that we haven't touched on. (01:16:08:02 - 01:16:11:02)

Ryan: Right. (01:16:11:02 - 01:16:11:14)

Ryan: Um, you know, you were talking a little bit earlier throughout the week, (01:16:11:15 - 01:16:15:07)

Ryan: you know that, um, you know, some, sometimes our ideas of success and any in (01:16:15:10 - 01:16:21:03)

Ryan: anything that we do is fortune (01:16:21:03 - 01:16:22:10)

Ryan: and fame and the biggest and best and top of the top dog. (01:16:22:10 - 01:16:25:19)

Ryan: That is better off, too, but I love how you were describing (01:16:26:07 - 01:16:29:05)

Ryan: kind of like the modified vision for for your for your life, (01:16:29:05 - 01:16:32:09)

Ryan: your career and your legacy, which is basically where you're at. (01:16:32:09 - 01:16:35:14)

Ryan: So I'd love to hear more about like how you, how you define success, um, (01:16:35:14 - 01:16:41:03)

Ryan: and what you do and kind of the hopes for your legacy. (01:16:41:04 - 01:16:46:22)

Ryan: I think (01:16:46:22 - 01:16:47:12)

Ryan: success, (01:16:49:04 - 01:16:49:21)

Ryan: you know, being a successful person, (01:16:49:21 - 01:16:52:21)

Ryan: that's perceived many different ways. (01:16:52:21 - 01:16:54:23)

Ryan: Some people being successful is you have $1,000,000 (01:16:55:06 - 01:16:58:23)

Ryan: in the bank and some people are more simple. (01:16:58:23 - 01:17:01:13)

Ryan: Being successful to others is I have a hot meal on the table today. (01:17:02:02 - 01:17:06:19)

Ryan: That's a pretty broad spectrum. (01:17:06:19 - 01:17:09:21)

Ryan: I guess my take on success, (01:17:09:21 - 01:17:11:00)

Ryan: I guess my take on success, (01:17:11:00 - 01:17:12:20)

Ryan: there's many levels of it (01:17:13:07 - 01:17:15:21)

Ryan: to speak directly towards framing. (01:17:15:21 - 01:17:18:07)

Ryan: Carpenter (01:17:18:07 - 01:17:19:16)

Ryan: Don't fall into that (01:17:20:05 - 01:17:23:06)

Ryan: thought or ideal that for me to be successful, (01:17:23:06 - 01:17:26:23)

Ryan: I need to own my own framing company. (01:17:26:23 - 01:17:30:06)

Ryan: I need to be the boss, I need to have 15 trucks and I want a TV commercial. (01:17:30:06 - 01:17:35:04)

Ryan: So that's great. (01:17:35:04 - 01:17:36:16)

Ryan: If you get to that level, that is certainly successful. (01:17:36:16 - 01:17:40:01)

Ryan: But I won't respect you anymore. (01:17:41:22 - 01:17:44:08)

Ryan: Then I'll respect the 35 year old man (01:17:44:08 - 01:17:47:03)

Ryan: who's came to work every day and he's the top dog on that job site. (01:17:47:03 - 01:17:51:01)

Ryan: He may not own the company. (01:17:51:07 - 01:17:52:15)

Ryan: That's not what impresses me. (01:17:53:19 - 01:17:55:03)

Ryan: What impresses me about that other guy (01:17:55:03 - 01:17:57:12)

Ryan: is he has the wherewithal and the know how and he shows his passion. (01:17:57:12 - 01:18:01:02)

Ryan: To me that is successful. (01:18:01:12 - 01:18:04:01)

Ryan: I don't think there's a ceiling, (01:18:04:13 - 01:18:07:08)

Ryan: if you will, on the ladder of success (01:18:07:13 - 01:18:10:00)

Ryan: in the in our framing world. (01:18:10:12 - 01:18:12:13)

Ryan: I think that can be looked at many different ways. (01:18:13:01 - 01:18:15:05)

Ryan: If money is your end goal, then that's how you will measure your success. (01:18:15:05 - 01:18:19:02)

Ryan: If knowledge and understanding is your end goal, then (01:18:19:12 - 01:18:22:14)

Ryan: that'll be your skill for success. (01:18:23:02 - 01:18:26:04)

Ryan: I tend not to judge a book by its cover because I've met some interesting people (01:18:26:04 - 01:18:31:00)

Ryan: in this line of work every walk of life, as I've mentioned so (01:18:31:00 - 01:18:34:03)

Ryan: I think there's small triumphs every day (01:18:35:04 - 01:18:37:12)

Ryan: that we should all recognize when they happen. (01:18:37:23 - 01:18:41:02)

Ryan: Kind of throw that in your bag of life (01:18:41:23 - 01:18:44:19)

Ryan: experience, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. (01:18:44:19 - 01:18:48:05)

Ryan: That's the other thing (01:18:48:10 - 01:18:49:09)

Ryan: to me. (01:18:50:13 - 01:18:51:20)

Ryan: I feel (01:18:52:02 - 01:18:53:21)

Ryan: successful. (01:18:54:09 - 01:18:55:18)

Ryan: I as a carpenter, I, (01:18:55:18 - 01:18:58:06)

Ryan: I was interested in reframing my whole career. (01:18:58:06 - 01:19:00:19)

Ryan: I've I've brought myself to a level (01:19:00:19 - 01:19:03:07)

Ryan: that I never thought I would ever get to. (01:19:04:19 - 01:19:07:02)

Ryan: And now I have this opportunity to share this with hopefully many others. (01:19:07:02 - 01:19:12:10)

Ryan: To me (01:19:12:17 - 01:19:13:23)

Ryan: you couldn't put a price on that. (01:19:14:19 - 01:19:16:22)

Ryan: So I think successes (01:19:16:22 - 01:19:20:13)

Ryan: there's levels of it and it's just a (01:19:21:16 - 01:19:24:14)

Ryan: it's a way of thinking like like I said in my course, you know, (01:19:26:18 - 01:19:29:12)

Ryan: yeah, money and fame and fortune and being popular, (01:19:30:07 - 01:19:34:19)

Ryan: you know, like, you know, a high school kid to be successful, (01:19:34:21 - 01:19:37:22)

Ryan: he wants to be the most popular person there. Right? (01:19:37:22 - 01:19:40:03)

Ryan: He gets out of high school. (01:19:40:14 - 01:19:41:19)

Ryan: Success to him might be, man, if I could afford a car. (01:19:41:19 - 01:19:45:06)

Ryan: Right. (01:19:45:07 - 01:19:45:15)

Ryan: Gets a car now he's he's successful and we should always be reaching. (01:19:45:15 - 01:19:48:19)

Ryan: I don't think as a human being (01:19:50:05 - 01:19:52:23)

Ryan: it should be about money. (01:19:54:08 - 01:19:56:01)

Ryan: If that is a fruit of your labor, (01:19:56:01 - 01:19:58:07)

Ryan: that's just a reward. (01:19:59:14 - 01:20:00:16)

Ryan: That's part of it. (01:20:00:16 - 01:20:02:07)

Ryan: So if you take my courses (01:20:02:07 - 01:20:05:15)

Ryan: as an effort to increase your productivity (01:20:05:15 - 01:20:08:06)

Ryan: and that brings you more money, that's a bonus, right? (01:20:09:01 - 01:20:12:04)

Ryan: More importantly, I would say you're successful (01:20:12:20 - 01:20:16:01)

Ryan: because you learned it, you understood it, and that was just an end result. (01:20:16:01 - 01:20:19:17)

Ryan: I wouldn't let the money side define that, but that's just me. (01:20:20:09 - 01:20:23:23)

Ryan: I'm a humble, simple person. (01:20:24:14 - 01:20:26:10)

Ryan: I'm a carpenter. (01:20:26:10 - 01:20:27:21)

Ryan: Me. You don't get much more simple than guys like me. (01:20:28:08 - 01:20:30:19)

Ryan: We launch on piles of wood. (01:20:31:07 - 01:20:36:06)

Ryan: Is very complex. (01:20:36:06 - 01:20:37:13)

Ryan: Now, as I understand. (01:20:37:13 - 01:20:38:10)

Ryan: It, they all hell yeah, yeah, yeah. (01:20:38:10 - 01:20:39:17)

Ryan: It, they all hell yeah, yeah, yeah. (01:20:39:17 - 01:20:40:14)

Ryan: I can't walk on water. (01:20:40:14 - 01:20:41:17)

Ryan: That would be interesting. (01:20:41:17 - 01:20:44:16)

Ryan: What what do you hope you leave behind? (01:20:44:16 - 01:20:46:12)

Ryan: I hope that (01:20:47:22 - 01:20:50:04)

Ryan: if I. (01:20:50:04 - 01:20:50:12)

Ryan: If I had a legacy, so to speak, that it was (01:20:50:12 - 01:20:55:20)

Ryan: someone would maybe watch these (01:20:56:22 - 01:20:59:02)

Ryan: or any of the things I've shared with teaching and (01:20:59:14 - 01:21:02:22)

Ryan: take away. (01:21:03:23 - 01:21:05:22)

Ryan: Wow. That guy loved framing. (01:21:06:16 - 01:21:10:17)

Ryan: He loved it. (01:21:11:15 - 01:21:12:20)

Ryan: You could see it. (01:21:12:20 - 01:21:17:07)

Ryan: He enjoyed every part of it. (01:21:17:07 - 01:21:18:16)

Ryan: It was it was part of who he was. And (01:21:18:16 - 01:21:21:03)

Ryan: it's so great that he put all this out here (01:21:22:15 - 01:21:25:03)

Ryan: for us, you know? (01:21:26:05 - 01:21:27:17)

Ryan: And if that can stick around and people can take (01:21:27:17 - 01:21:31:19)

Ryan: an education from me or share in a passion (01:21:32:19 - 01:21:37:18)

Ryan: or at least an appreciation of what it takes to go out in a hot, scalding (01:21:38:10 - 01:21:43:15)

Ryan: sun and the snowstorms and all the things we do (01:21:43:15 - 01:21:46:19)

Ryan: just to perform our job (01:21:47:15 - 01:21:50:17)

Ryan: would be the ultimate honor (01:21:50:17 - 01:21:53:09)

Ryan: to look at a carpenter (01:21:53:09 - 01:21:55:15)

Ryan: and really appreciate the amount of his soul that it takes (01:21:56:12 - 01:22:00:16)

Ryan: to perform his job. (01:22:01:23 - 01:22:03:21)

Ryan: That would be (01:22:03:21 - 01:22:05:15)

Ryan: my ultimate goal. (01:22:07:05 - 01:22:11:03)

Ryan: Above and beyond the education is to share (01:22:11:03 - 01:22:14:15)

Ryan: what it really is to be (01:22:16:00 - 01:22:17:19)

Ryan: a tradesperson. Wow. (01:22:17:19 - 01:22:23:07)

Ryan: In. Yeah, he rendered me speechless. (01:22:23:14 - 01:22:28:05)

Ryan: So, um. (01:22:28:05 - 01:22:29:20)

Ryan: What else? (01:22:29:20 - 01:22:30:09)

Ryan: What else would you like to share? (01:22:30:09 - 01:22:34:05)

Ryan: I don't know. (01:22:34:05 - 01:22:36:15)

Ryan: Don't know if there's anything at this point. (01:22:36:15 - 01:22:38:11)

Ryan: I just made myself speechless. (01:22:38:11 - 01:22:48:07)

Ryan: I'm grateful for all. (01:22:48:07 - 01:22:51:07)

Ryan: I'm grateful for the life that this line of work has provided me. (01:22:51:13 - 01:22:56:12)

Ryan: You know I don't have a, (01:22:57:04 - 01:22:59:11)

Ryan: you know, race cars and speedboats and a mansion on the hill. (01:22:59:22 - 01:23:02:15)

Ryan: But I have (01:23:02:15 - 01:23:05:06)

Ryan: some really great friends that I'll have the rest of my life. (01:23:05:06 - 01:23:08:17)

Ryan: I have some great stories. (01:23:09:08 - 01:23:11:00)

Ryan: I have a particular set of skills that took me half of my life (01:23:11:00 - 01:23:16:12)

Ryan: to learn. (01:23:16:21 - 01:23:20:06)

Ryan: It's all been worth it. (01:23:20:06 - 01:23:21:09)

Ryan: The good and the bad. I'll take it. I wouldn't change any of it. (01:23:21:09 - 01:23:24:00)

Ryan: And I'm grateful for (01:23:25:16 - 01:23:28:13)

Ryan: this opportunity. (01:23:28:13 - 01:23:30:04)

Ryan: You know, I feel like (01:23:30:04 - 01:23:32:03)

Ryan: for me, touching back on success, to me, (01:23:32:19 - 01:23:36:20)

Ryan: this is this is a level of success for me that I, (01:23:36:20 - 01:23:41:13)

Ryan: up until April, never would have imagined (01:23:42:15 - 01:23:45:20)

Ryan: that my voice could get so big (01:23:46:10 - 01:23:48:21)

Ryan: to share in what is so simple and silly to me framing houses. (01:23:49:11 - 01:23:53:16)

Ryan: It's just that's just my day to day life (01:23:53:16 - 01:23:55:20)

Ryan: and to get to teach what I'm doing and, potentially (01:23:56:17 - 01:23:59:22)

Ryan: reach (01:24:01:08 - 01:24:02:07)

Ryan: other people like myself and give them (01:24:02:23 - 01:24:05:09)

Ryan: a piece of my soul. (01:24:06:21 - 01:24:09:17)

Ryan: That's the good stuff. (01:24:09:17 - 01:24:11:16)

Ryan: That's really (01:24:12:12 - 01:24:14:01)

Ryan: that's special. (01:24:14:21 - 01:24:15:22)

Ryan: I'll never, ever, ever be able beat this. (01:24:15:22 - 01:24:19:10)

Ryan: This is it. (01:24:20:04 - 01:24:21:09)

Ryan: So it's been an awesome experience. (01:24:22:12 - 01:24:25:03)

Ryan: I'm so grateful for all of it I'm grateful. (01:24:26:02 - 01:24:29:11)

Ryan: And now that we're through this, I'm (01:24:29:11 - 01:24:32:10)

Ryan: I'm looking forward to a regular workweek (01:24:33:02 - 01:24:35:14)

Ryan: where I don't have Joey and Alfie and all these guys in my face, but (01:24:35:14 - 01:24:39:15)

Ryan: I've really loved every second of it. (01:24:40:16 - 01:24:43:05)

Ryan: You know, I called my father, I talked to him. (01:24:43:05 - 01:24:45:23)

Ryan: Actually, I didn't call him. (01:24:47:07 - 01:24:49:02)

Ryan: I sent him a few pictures and (01:24:49:07 - 01:24:51:17)

Ryan: we exchanged a few texts and he told me, enjoy all of these moments, son. (01:24:51:17 - 01:24:56:02)

Ryan: And I did just that. (01:24:56:09 - 01:24:58:13)

Ryan: I took a lot of screenshots in my brain, (01:24:59:02 - 01:25:01:22)

Ryan: so it'll be weird (01:25:03:18 - 01:25:06:01)

Ryan: walking in here next week and all this stuff is gone. (01:25:06:01 - 01:25:08:15)

Ryan: It's going to be different, but it's been great and I appreciate all of it. (01:25:09:08 - 01:25:13:11)

Ryan: And I hopefully, hopefully we help some carpenters, right? (01:25:13:11 - 01:25:17:13)

Ryan: That's our end goal. So let it rip. (01:25:17:13 - 01:25:20:03)

Ryan: Get it out there. (01:25:20:15 - 01:25:22:01)

Ryan: Favorite. The only. (01:25:22:03 - 01:25:23:14)

Ryan: Thing. Oh, (01:25:24:01 - 01:25:27:03)

Ryan: you never know, man. (01:25:29:07 - 01:25:30:06)

Ryan: You might. (01:25:30:06 - 01:25:30:13)
