# Ryan Interview

Ryan: Ready to roll them around town. 

Ryan: Speed. 

Ryan: Oh, man. We get to do this again. 

Ryan: All big six, bigger house, big rips. 

Ryan: 105, take one. 

Ryan: Substitute, make reference. 

Ryan: All week. 

Ryan: All week long. And five and five. 

Ryan: Yeah. What an experience. 

Ryan: All right. 

Ryan: Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, anything on your mind? 

Ryan: You want to roll up the tongue? 

Ryan: Sure. You guys are awesome. 

Ryan: Did not expect that none of this 

Ryan: obviously was expected, but, 

Ryan: like. 

Ryan: Like I sent you in the text yesterday with that cool picture. 

Ryan: You guys all have a brother in Buffalo. 

Ryan: From here on out, no doubt about it. 

Ryan: Enjoyed every moment. 

Ryan: As weird as it has been. 

Ryan: It's been pretty cool. 

Ryan: Which is weird to not have had any homemade buffalo wings in your backyard. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Yeah, that's kind of a. 

Ryan: Oh, I like you can get great wings anywhere. 

Ryan: I don't know why they because buffalo is not really famous for anything. 

Ryan: It certainly isn't our football or hockey team. 

Ryan: They're both horrible. 

Ryan: So, uh, they made the chicken wings kind of notorious. 

Ryan: Yeah, I have. Good. 

Ryan: I eat chicken wings everywhere 

Ryan: I go and everywhere I go on like these are better than they are back home. 

Ryan: So I don't I don't know what it is. 

Ryan: I think it was first created. 

Ryan: Here was where that came from. 

Ryan: Okay. Yeah. I haven't seen a single chicken. 

Ryan: Yeah, all of it. Where we are are currently 

Ryan: at North Tonawanda is where the carousel was invented 

Ryan: right here. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Interesting fact. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: I feel like I'm driving in circles. All the time. 

Ryan: Right. What? What's your. 

Ryan: When you, uh. 

Ryan: You do like that? Definitely like maps. 

Ryan: So none of us like, tape my feet down. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Speaking of space and time, I'm gonna 

Ryan: you talk about the significance of the space behind you. 

Ryan: Yeah, this shop, we. 

Ryan: We put this together over the course of the last couple of years. 

Ryan: The idea was just what we're doing, move the roof cutting portion of our 

Ryan: our framing details inside, 

Ryan: which was great because it got rid of weather, 

Ryan: you know, and more importantly, 

Ryan: we've noticed now is the space that it saves on site 

Ryan: for the rest of the guys 

Ryan: to have their material kind of scattered about and the forklift. 

Ryan: So I'm not complaining. I don't mind it. 

Ryan: It's nice. 

Ryan: You know, the hot days, it's a little cooler. 

Ryan: The middle of winter, it's a little warmer. 

Ryan: So it's been interesting. 

Ryan: It's very different. 

Ryan: It's not typical for the industry. But, 

Ryan: hey, we'll we'll 

Ryan: we'll try anything that's going to make us faster. 

Ryan: That was the thought. 

Ryan: What does, um. 

Ryan: What does a. Typical day look like for you? 

Ryan: Uh, typical day for me. 

Ryan: There's a lot of cutting. 

Ryan: You know, 

Ryan: if I'm calculating, it'll be depending on the size of the job. 

Ryan: I could spend several days sitting at the little drawing 

Ryan: table, crunching numbers, staring at a plain view drawing. 

Ryan: I like music, so it's always pretty loud in here. 

Ryan: I have the radio going, I'll. 

Ryan: I'll listen to my own playlists, kind of travel around. 

Ryan: Music's very important to me 

Ryan: when I'm cutting. 

Ryan: That's kind of self-explanatory. 

Ryan: But it gets messy. 

Ryan: I. I'll come in here. 

Ryan: I usually start around 7 a.m.. 

Ryan: I'll stop around nine 930, have a cup of coffee, a bite to eat. 

Ryan: Lunch is noon and I'll work till 330, 5:00 depending. 

Ryan: And then after the cutting and the calculating, 

Ryan: we trailer the roof right out to the jobsite and I get 

Ryan: to spend a few days with the guys and we put the roof together and 

Ryan: fortunately lately, the last year or so, it's just been right back to the shop. 

Ryan: There's another drawing, here's the roof, 

Ryan: and I'll kind of get my bearings with that. 

Ryan: And then I'll go out to the site and I'll take a guy or two 

Ryan: snap lines on the foundation, get it squared up as we've covered 

Ryan: and transfer the the dimensions over to the plan and start all over again. 

Ryan: Mark up a plan, create a plan view, cut it, build it. 

Ryan: So it's very repetitious for me. 

Ryan: Sometimes I get a little a little break if we get, you know, 

Ryan: if it's not important that I get started on the next one 

Ryan: because I'm so far ahead, I'll fall back and build stairs 

Ryan: or install stairs, you know, pick up work like that on site just to help out. 

Ryan: But like I said, it's been pretty steady, just roofs for quite some time. 

Ryan: We've seen all of the 

Ryan: thought and the math that's involved with what you do throughout the week. 

Ryan: And I'm curious how like 

Ryan: what you know, what are you thinking about? 

Ryan: You want to wake up one day to clear this. 

Ryan: Morning's early morning person here? 

Ryan: Most of my hobbies are early morning things as well. 

Ryan: Fishing, hunting. Done that my whole life. 

Ryan: So I'm up early every day, 5:00, you know, quarter to five. 

Ryan: Have my coffee. 

Ryan: That's the thing with this. 

Ryan: It can be very demanding for me because I get so into it 

Ryan: that it's constantly on my mind. 

Ryan: You know, when I'm driving to work, I'm noticing the rooflines and you know, 

Ryan: a lot of times it's the same roofs I've looked at hundreds of times, 

Ryan: but I'll still find something I missed or appreciate, something I didn't notice. 

Ryan: So mornings I try to stay focused. 

Ryan: All day I turn my phone off, I check it frequently. 

Ryan: Case it's, you know, a job site issue but distractions 

Ryan: will trip me up and then I'll make mistakes. 

Ryan: And my mistakes are huge. 

Ryan: So I try to keep them to a minimum, but. 

Ryan: And then at night I lay in bed and think about roof framing 

Ryan: literally. 

Ryan: So I think I actually with that being said, 

Ryan: a lot of my techniques and approach, I maybe learned subconsciously 

Ryan: because it's always on my mind. 

Ryan: And then when I get to work, I kind of apply some ideas or thoughts 

Ryan: that I've had. 

Ryan: So it's been a long thing to evolve to what it is now for. 

Ryan: I'm sorry. Just what you're. 

Ryan: You're. 

Ryan: You're sorry, Alfie. 

Ryan: Okay, so where did it start for you? 

Ryan: Framing in general or the roof? 

Ryan: How did. 

Ryan: How did all of this creep into your mind so pervasively? 

Ryan: So we would go back to well, 

Ryan: as as a younger child, I'd say teens. 

Ryan: My neighbor that lived across the street in the town 

Ryan: I grew up in, his father was a contractor. 

Ryan: So my friend and I would always be helping him, 

Ryan: you know, weekends, evenings 

Ryan: through high school and even middle school 

Ryan: on the job, just, you know, cleaning up, doing things like that, stacking lumber. 

Ryan: So I was I was around it. 

Ryan: I've always had 

Ryan: an interest in building things 

Ryan: since I was far as I can remember. 

Ryan: Like Christmas would come every year and I would ask for plastic 

Ryan: airplane models, testers, models, and I would build them. 

Ryan: But, you know, dozens at a time. 

Ryan: I had them hanging all over the ceiling in my bedroom. 

Ryan: Aviation's always been huge. 

Ryan: So that that turned into pillows if you've ever heard that's a company. 

Ryan: But the rubber band powered 

Ryan: where it's all stick framed and then you put tissue paper 

Ryan: and used soap to stick the tissue and then water decals. 

Ryan: And then that evolved into radio control airplanes. 

Ryan: And I was building and flying those. 

Ryan: So building has always been there. 

Ryan: So I graduated high school, I work that summer. 

Ryan: Oh, also 

Ryan: my father remodeled the house that I grew up in 

Ryan: and he paid the contractor he hired to employ me for a summer. 

Ryan: So it was that was my first taste that, 

Ryan: you know, a decent little paycheck every week. 

Ryan: You know, I had had I had other jobs delivering pizza and things like that. 

Ryan: But working on our own home that I had grown up in, 

Ryan: maybe kind of drove the nail home to get to see 

Ryan: what was behind all the walls that I was so used to for so many years. 

Ryan: And then to bring it all back together and make it new. 

Ryan: I then 

Ryan: I went to college. 

Ryan: I did a year and a half, almost two years again the whole time 

Ryan: during breaks, winter breaks all summer. 

Ryan: I'd take pick up work working on a framing crew 

Ryan: and eventually I went full time, 

Ryan: some sometime around 99, 2000. And 

Ryan: my love for it just kind of took off. 

Ryan: There was everything the smells, the sounds, the crew working together. 

Ryan: There wasn't anything about it that I didn't enjoy. 

Ryan: I mean, the weather, but that just goes with it like anything. 

Ryan: And fast forward, I met my wife 

Ryan: in college there and she graduated. 

Ryan: She's a couple of years older than I. 

Ryan: She moved out here to western New York. 

Ryan: I stuck around back home in Oswego for six months 

Ryan: and I followed her out. 

Ryan: Then I got out here and I looked for a job. 

Ryan: There was hundreds of ads in the newspapers and I called every phone 

Ryan: number and I didn't hear anything for like two weeks. 

Ryan: So I had a little bit of money. 

Ryan: We had an apartment. 

Ryan: I didn't know anybody. 

Ryan: I had no friends, no family, so to speak of. 

Ryan: Sorry. Right. 

Ryan: Getting some kind of sound coming out of this. 

Ryan: I had 

Ryan: our boats commuted 

Ryan: over here in New 

Ryan: to turn up the volume. 

Ryan: Yeah. Oh, do we have. 

Ryan: There's only one way to 

Ryan: run into that. 

Ryan: You know, that's you get real 

Ryan: life on your left in the room today. 

Ryan: Oh you do it on that. 

Ryan: I would do it. 

Ryan: Oh but so when you mute. 

Ryan: Mute, this is just your mic. 

Ryan: So that's if we're hearing him, 

Ryan: you know, I think it was me too, you know? 

Ryan: I don't know. We should be good enough 

Ryan: was enough for 

Ryan: it's been good up until this moment I'm getting so. 

Ryan: Thank you. 

Ryan: You didn't take anything up until then? 

Ryan: Yeah, it just started to feel 

Ryan: sort of up, I guess. 

Ryan: Okay, so you followed your favorite person out? 

Ryan: Yeah. So 

Ryan: I ended up out here 

Ryan: western New York and couldn't find a job as a carpenter for a couple of weeks. 

Ryan: And then all of a sudden, one day, 

Ryan: you know, my cell phone and this is when cell phones were humongous, right? 

Ryan: We're going back. 

Ryan: I got a whole lot of voicemails and not knowing any better. 

Ryan: I, I took the first guy his offer. 

Ryan: They called me back and he worked 

Ryan: in the south towns was it's what we call it here. 

Ryan: But I had no idea what that meant. 

Ryan: So he asked me, you know, where are you coming from? 

Ryan: And I told him and he said, Well, that's like a 40, 45 minute ride every day. 

Ryan: And at that point, I was just so happy to have found some work 

Ryan: that I did that for almost two years. And 

Ryan: I had an older pickup truck 

Ryan: and it started to, you know, have ailments and fuel lines. 

Ryan: I'd fill up my tank on the way to work 

Ryan: and the truck would sit there all day and I'd get in and it would be empty. 

Ryan: I just I couldn't afford to keep doing that. So I 

Ryan: over the course of those couple of years, I had met some other people 

Ryan: and had started, you know, creating racial friendships and relationships. 

Ryan: And one of my brother in law's 

Ryan: best friends worked for a pretty large 

Ryan: commercial construction outfit, and he got me in there. 

Ryan: So I did commercial carpentry for several years, which was great. 

Ryan: I had never been exposed to 

Ryan: drywall and metal stud framing and grid ceilings, and I loved it. 

Ryan: I did that for a few years. 

Ryan: And then him and I, he and I, that same guy became friends 

Ryan: and we started our own business, went back to doing residential stuff. 

Ryan: We did a lot of framing, kind of everything. 

Ryan: I've been lucky with that. 

Ryan: I've, I've done a lot. 

Ryan: It hasn't always been framing, 

Ryan: but framing has been always kind of where my heart was. 

Ryan: I'd get away from it for a little while and I would always come back. 

Ryan: I just I missed. 

Ryan: It was like an old friend. 

Ryan: So I hopped crews here and there, you know, it didn't work out with him 

Ryan: and I, which is fine. 

Ryan: We're still great friends. 

Ryan: I love the guy. 

Ryan: Tried my own hand at running a framing crew, which was amazing. 

Ryan: We were very successful, kind of hit a lull in the work around here. 

Ryan: We had sort of a decline in the industry and a recession 

Ryan: and found a 

Ryan: great company guy I'd been friends with for many years 

Ryan: and we just kind of built up what we've got going on now. 

Ryan: And the the roof cutting was always there and we were always that. 

Ryan: It always gripped me even back before I had moved out here. 

Ryan: I always would look at the older guy out in the front cut 

Ryan: in the rafters, and I just I admired it. 

Ryan: How could he 

Ryan: obtain all of these cuts and measurements? 

Ryan: And then everything just goes together so perfectly? 

Ryan: And it you know, I think no doubt that's every frame and Carpenter's favorite part, 

Ryan: because it's different on on every house walls or walls and floors or floors. 

Ryan: I mean, there's, you know, subtle differences, but the roof is its unique. 

Ryan: So I just I worked on it. 

Ryan: It interests me and I would take that interest home 

Ryan: with me or I'd stay late and we would run string lines 

Ryan: to figure our hip angles and try to calculate our cuts that way. 

Ryan: And I would record all of that in a little book that I kept 

Ryan: in my truck. 

Ryan: I'd build little models, I'd try things, I'd stay after work 

Ryan: when something wasn't quite right and I knew it was off a little bit. 

Ryan: I would stay and try to teach myself, you know, what could I have done differently? 

Ryan: Or What am I missing? 

Ryan: Why is this off? 

Ryan: Why are my, my and my bevels a little off? 

Ryan: You know, why did I come up a little short? 

Ryan: And that's when I first started drawing in plan view. 

Ryan: You know, I thought, why can't I look at this 

Ryan: from above and see what's taking place? 

Ryan: And then the more and more I practice and I created 

Ryan: dozens of those completely wrong. 

Ryan: It was all about the rise. 

Ryan: I'm not sure where I first maybe got that idea, but 

Ryan: there isn't a lot of information on it. 

Ryan: You can find it, 

Ryan: but it's 

Ryan: it's not very elaborate 

Ryan: to the extent that we've taken it here. 

Ryan: So I've kind of turned it into 

Ryan: my method. It's 

Ryan: I can do it without that now 

Ryan: using the angles and having the know how. 

Ryan: But that took me many years to realize I don't really necessarily 

Ryan: need the plan view, but it's always there and I'm still I still use it. 

Ryan: I shouldn't say I don't because I do. 

Ryan: That's the most important part of the technique that I'm applying. 

Ryan: But as I've mentioned in our courses, 

Ryan: the more you use those, the more you start to see 

Ryan: different scenarios and the roof 

Ryan: kind of comes to life right in front of you on a piece of plywood. So 

Ryan: yeah, it's just been a long, 

Ryan: passionate journey 

Ryan: and I feel lucky for it. 

Ryan: That's the other thing 

Ryan: I may not have ever felt this way. 

Ryan: Had the area that I live in and work in, 

Ryan: didn't have such great architecture and these great roofs. 

Ryan: So that was kind of out of necessity 

Ryan: and it always intrigued me, so I just kind of followed it on my own. 

Ryan: So this has been great to get to share that with fellow carpenters. 

Ryan: So yeah, wild. 

Ryan: 1/2, guys. 

Ryan: So, Alan, you have headphones. 

Ryan: Yeah, well, I think 

Ryan: so. Hearing something, it's. 

Ryan: So, so subtle. 

Ryan: Like a like a vibration. 

Ryan: No, no, it's a echo of a speaker. 

Ryan: Despite the things are both know 

Ryan: you going to talk for a second? 

Ryan: Yeah. Alan, are you happy? 

Ryan: Miserable. Oh. Oh, yeah. 

Ryan: Yeah. Is it my mike? 

Ryan: No, no, it's all of the sounds that. 

Ryan: Okay, it's just like, 

Ryan: oh, it should be. 

Ryan: Yeah, I don't hear anything of it. 

Ryan: I actually can't hear what you guys are hearing 

Ryan: me either. 

Ryan: I just thought it might have been just coming from the iPod 

Ryan: and we just put a cable in it. 

Ryan: So see, further to the track. 

Ryan: Is it scrubber bill? Was that the term. 

Ryan: Yeah, it is. 

Ryan: All right. 

Ryan: Also, thank you. 

Ryan: Everybody settle and we'll see. 

Ryan: What was it about framing and like kept you going back? 

Ryan: Going back, going back. Sound like that? 

Ryan: What do you think it was about you and framing you know what drew would re 

Ryan: what what keeps drawing you to and what drew you to it? 

Ryan: You know, I've always kind of wondered and asked myself that same thing, 

Ryan: like whether you believe in destiny or any of that. 

Ryan: I just something about assembling things has always just been 

Ryan: even now 

Ryan: I'm a father of three and my oldest son. 

Ryan: We're always like, we've got a motor apart, 

Ryan: you know, we're working on a dirt bike. 

Ryan: We're doing this or that. 

Ryan: So it's it's always been interesting to me to watch something 

Ryan: take shape from efforts 

Ryan: from myself or my colleagues. 

Ryan: A lot of that with the framing 

Ryan: and is the way it feels when 

Ryan: you get in your truck in the morning, you have your cup of coffee, 

Ryan: you got your tool belt in the back, you're driving to work, 

Ryan: listening to the radio. 

Ryan: You're thinking about the day you're planning, 

Ryan: kind of how it's going to go. 

Ryan: And then you arrive and you know, the crew is there and there's piles of lumber 

Ryan: and you watch the sun come up and then, you know, 

Ryan: you hear the sound of the nail guns and the saws going in, the fresh lumber 

Ryan: smell, and everyone's busy and the sun the on your back or in your face. 

Ryan: And it's just a feeling 

Ryan: like you have a real purpose. 

Ryan: Like, you know, today is going to be a good day. 

Ryan: So for me, it's it's just kind of there. 

Ryan: I don't, 

Ryan: you know, my, my, my father, 

Ryan: I really didn't follow in anyone's footsteps as far as the trade work goes. 

Ryan: It's just always interested me. And 

Ryan: once I started doing it, it became more and more apparent that, 

Ryan: Hey, I think I've found what I'm good at. 

Ryan: And for that I'm blessed. 

Ryan: It wasn't it wasn't really ever about the money for me. 

Ryan: It was about learning. 

Ryan: I've met some of the most incredible people in my life 

Ryan: working as a as a carpenter, some of my best days and worst. 

Ryan: I couldn't lie about that. 

Ryan: But some of my best days have been spent building houses. 

Ryan: I wouldn't trade it for for anything. 

Ryan: So I feel lucky for that. 

Ryan: You know, I think maybe 

Ryan: maybe people are meant to do certain things. 

Ryan: I don't know. 

Ryan: I like to believe that I have a lot of other interests, 

Ryan: but I don't feel the way I feel about framing about anything else 

Ryan: as far as my my passion and interest for it. 

Ryan: You know, we go we go on vacation or I'm with my family 

Ryan: and we're all having a conversation in the truck and here comes a framing job. 

Ryan: We drive by and 

Ryan: I just get pulled out of the conversation and I'm looking at the guys. 

Ryan: And while that's cool and I'm trying to guess what the roof pitches are working on 

Ryan: and I'm noticing 

Ryan: all the little things, you know, and then I'm back in the conversation. 

Ryan: It's just, it's just part of who I am, 

Ryan: which I'll take that. 

Ryan: I'm okay with that. 

Ryan: Once I just just realize that the 

Ryan: people oh, you know, 

Ryan: I have a theory. 

Ryan: I wonder if it's actually coming from the exact same 

Ryan: things you even know. 

Ryan: So you just got to the more, I guess, right? 

Ryan: Right. But 

Ryan: also, yeah, um. 

Ryan: I think that's really cool to they described it earlier too. 

Ryan: Like, you know, I don't think every kid who like, 

Ryan: you know, remembers like their parents generation or anything like that of Oh, 

Ryan: look how cool it is to see what's inside you and all of that, you know? 

Ryan: Yeah. Protected me. 

Ryan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: So it sounds like there's always been 

Ryan: some form of emotional connection to, you know, the constructed world around you. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: So I guess I'm curious, kind of like, 

Ryan: you know, and that's, that's one thing I think about a lot doing this 

Ryan: type of media is like, you know, the big picture here is shelter, 

Ryan: which is obviously an essential human need and our improvements. 

Ryan: Yeah, sure. 

Ryan: Have advanced civilizations. So 

Ryan: the first thing I think 

Ryan: of when I think of shelter is the roof. 

Ryan: Me too. 

Ryan: Over your head. Yeah. 

Ryan: Um, yeah. 

Ryan: So I wonder. 

Ryan: Yeah, like, is there, 

Ryan: you know, what's the you know, 

Ryan: I mean, you're you're a great writer, as I've seen. 

Ryan: So I'm curious, kind of like, what's your poetic connection to the roof itself. 

Ryan: The roof aspect 

Ryan: and a house to me? 

Ryan: Well, obviously, that's one of the all the parts that are important to me. 

Ryan: I would say the roof is more most important, 

Ryan: but I'm going to be partial to that. 

Ryan: But to me, the roof defines us. 

Ryan: It kind of tells the story of the walls below because the shape of the roof 

Ryan: follows the shape of the house. 

Ryan: So whether it's, you know, a big old house with wall 

Ryan: jugs everywhere, it's going to have lots of hips and valleys. 

Ryan: Or if it's a more subtle, simple house that's more square or rectangular shaped, 

Ryan: that roof is going to present itself in a different light as well. So 

Ryan: for me, when I'm up 

Ryan: inside the roof in the attic and we're putting it together, 

Ryan: you tend to get intimate with it. 

Ryan: When you set a vaguely, you go right to your your memory 

Ryan: of cutting and figuring and without even turning around, 

Ryan: you know, there's an inside corner there on the elevation view. 

Ryan: And then from looking at the prints for the whole time, you know, 

Ryan: hey, we're over the master bedroom because I labeled 

Ryan: that the for so 

Ryan: the situational awareness 

Ryan: while I'm on site actually assembling a roof 

Ryan: is unique to me because all the guys that I'm 

Ryan: with haven't been through that process that I've already burned. 

Ryan: I've already assembled the roof in my mind, multiple times. 

Ryan: So the roof 

Ryan: is unique to each dwelling 

Ryan: and it really does tell the story in so many ways. 

Ryan: When you look at them from above 

Ryan: and you're looking at the roof lines, it follows the exact shape of the house. 

Ryan: And then sometimes they throw little flares, 

Ryan: you know, maybe a turret roof or a bay or and those are cool little to me. 

Ryan: They're always like 

Ryan: personality. 

Ryan: I think each roof has a personality to it. 

Ryan: And they almost they almost talk to you. 

Ryan: You know, some are aggressive and they're very steep and they're cut up 

Ryan: and there's hips and valleys all over where there didn't need to be. 

Ryan: It could have been straight gables and easier roofline. 

Ryan: So they have a more robust, 

Ryan: sort of aggressive nature to them. 

Ryan: At least that's how I see them while others. 

Ryan: So sorry. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Now I hear why isn't the cable deployment the shot that was in. 

Ryan: I can adjust it. 

Ryan: I think that was the fix. 

Ryan: AKC Yeah, so we send the cable back first again. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Genius Doyle Simple that 

Ryan: give. 

Ryan: A lot of math with the. 

Ryan: I haven't thought about any of this stuff in so long. 

Ryan: Right. It's great that you're asking. 

Ryan: Oh yeah, that's cool. 

Ryan: Now I feel old like the last 22 years, just. 

Ryan: I don't know where they want. 

Ryan: Yeah. Let's not lose that train, though. Yeah. I'm so sorry. 

Ryan: I love that. I just think personality 

Ryan: values like. 

Ryan: Yeah, those. 

Ryan: Those great 

Ryan: Joey's upside down. 

Ryan: Yeah, it's like you put your 

Ryan: foot down. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Physically. 

Ryan: There you go. Well, there you go. There. 

Ryan: No. Yeah, but this doesn't want to rotate. 

Ryan: Yeah, you got to lock it. Well. 

Ryan: You almost had it. Almost. 

Ryan: There you go. 

Ryan: There's 

Ryan: technology. 

Ryan: All right. 

Ryan: The little interior to a straight up mirror. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Is right. 

Ryan: Yeah. But this is helping, right. With the. 

Ryan: Oh, yeah, this is great. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: For for this. 

Ryan: It's like it's perfect. 

Ryan: I don't know that it would have been helpful. 

Ryan: Yeah, no, you were right. 

Ryan: Yeah, I think that was fun. 

Ryan: That's I of feel like. Yeah, human to human. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: How's the Mike Allen. Okay, great. 

Ryan: Okay. 

Ryan: Well, good. Worked for 18 earlier and 

Ryan: cool. 

Ryan: All right, so you're riffing on the personality of the Hudson Valley. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: And some some roofs are more. 

Ryan: Much more simple, straightforward, forward and and subtle, 

Ryan: which give a feeling of. 

Ryan: It's kind of like when you go home to visit your folks after a while 

Ryan: and you feel like, you know, you just feel good inside. 

Ryan: Sometimes an easy roof will give me that feeling 

Ryan: because it's not challenging me 

Ryan: as much as maybe a more as I, 

Ryan: as I think I put it, aggressive type of roof. 

Ryan: So when I approach, you know, when I first get the blueprint and I approach, 

Ryan: you know, all of my methodology that I use, I'm kind of at ease 

Ryan: because I know it's really not a big challenge. 

Ryan: So we kind of become friends in the beginning because I know 

Ryan: you're not going to stomp me. 

Ryan: You're not going to, you know, trip me up. 

Ryan: So we're going to have a good week together. 

Ryan: And then when we go out and put it together, it's like I like 

Ryan: I love those roofs the best on a Friday, 

Ryan: a nice, straightforward, easy roof that was 

Ryan: friendly the whole time through the figuring and the building, 

Ryan: even to the roof sheathing when those happen on a Friday, 

Ryan: that is a magical weekend for me because it's just like, oh, yeah, oh, 

Ryan: there wasn't a whole bunch of stress and anxiety that and that. 

Ryan: That does come with some of the more challenging 

Ryan: roofs. 

Ryan: And I always welcome that because I do 

Ryan: like a challenge and I like to be it keeps me sharp. 

Ryan: As I mentioned before you you get intimate with these. 

Ryan: So some of them will keep me on my toes and keep me up at night 

Ryan: like a lot of nights 

Ryan: until we for me, the reward there is one. 

Ryan: We're on the on site and everything has gone together 

Ryan: with very small hiccups and to happen the truck at the end of the day and see it 

Ryan: together, it's the same feeling of, you know, a sigh of relief. 

Ryan: And then at that point, 

Ryan: I think I become friends with that roof 

Ryan: that has just been kind of a bully to me for the last couple of weeks. 

Ryan: Well, I never I've never been angry with one. 

Ryan: Feels weird to talk about a roof like that. 

Ryan: But for me, that's that's really what they are. 

Ryan: Some are challenges the whole time and some are friendly 

Ryan: and easy and more, you know, 

Ryan: feminine, if you will, 

Ryan: you know, pretty and you know, all of that. 

Ryan: So I hope there are other carpenters that can relate to this. 

Ryan: Otherwise I might be the weirdest dude in the world. 

Ryan: I talk to my project, man. 

Ryan: You have to. 

Ryan: Yeah, you have. 

Ryan: To know, I actually love this idea of personifying 

Ryan: what your what you're assembling and what you're building. 

Ryan: So to take that maybe even further, 

Ryan: it seems like whether it's an easy roof or a hard roof, 

Ryan: whether you guys have struggled or, you know, talked well together, 

Ryan: the end goal is protection to protect the family below. 

Ryan: Oh, yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: That that is such a reward. 

Ryan: Basically, we're building we're providing a service, right? 

Ryan: A basic human need, as you've mentioned, everyone needs shelter. 

Ryan: But more importantly, to see the excitement on the homeowners 

Ryan: faces when they stop. 

Ryan: We're building people's dreams, right? 

Ryan: We're turning a vision 

Ryan: that they have into a reality right before their eyes. 

Ryan: And to be a part of that, it's something that 

Ryan: becomes part of your fabric. 

Ryan: You know, you spend the more years you do this, 

Ryan: the more of those moments and feelings you kind of you keep them with you. 

Ryan: It's almost like you have a suitcase and you just you fire these these feelings 

Ryan: and these memories and they're and it's great to look back and recall on them. 

Ryan: I take a lot of photos nowadays. 

Ryan: It's with cell phone. 

Ryan: We all have amazing cameras, right on our phone. 

Ryan: But going back to the beginning, 

Ryan: it was a regular Kodak camera that I would have, you know, develop. 

Ryan: And then I would 

Ryan: you know, I had purchased my first digital camera and my wife and I. So 

Ryan: I've always taken pictures of the entire process. 

Ryan: Now it's more the roof stuff because it's really gripped my interest for so long. 

Ryan: But yeah, being a part of someone else's dreams and, 

Ryan: and seeing the joy that our efforts have brought 

Ryan: and the smiles and getting to meet all these different people, you know? 

Ryan: But, you know, you build a house for a young family, a couple with a small child 

Ryan: or or a couple with multiple children that just needed a bigger house or, 

Ryan: you know, you name it, every walk of life. 

Ryan: And to share in that, for me, 

Ryan: you couldn't put a price on that. 

Ryan: You couldn't. 

Ryan: And I hope that 

Ryan: as a carpenter that we've left our mark 

Ryan: on these people much in the same way 

Ryan: that they have us, even 

Ryan: though our work isn't seen once leave it all gets covered, right? 

Ryan: Drywall, insulation, paint, trim. 

Ryan: Carpenters come in and make it look beautiful with trim and fancy words. 

Ryan: And a roofer roofing company shows up and puts shingles down. 

Ryan: Or so everything that we've kind of poured our soul into does get covered up, but 

Ryan: it's the bones, it's the skeleton 

Ryan: of the house that these families will spend the rest of their days. 

Ryan: And to be a part of that, 

Ryan: there's a lot to be said for that means a lot to me, whether you see it or not. 

Ryan: I can still see it in my mind and photographs. So 

Ryan: yeah, it's cool how, how all the trades kind of rely on one 

Ryan: another and come together and to be one of the first ones in 

Ryan: feels kind of neat, you know, it's almost like the team captain, 

Ryan: you know, trim, carpenter, drywall or electricians. 

Ryan: We all work in unison, but without the framing contractor 

Ryan: and the framing carpenters is there's no house there. 

Ryan: So it's it's pretty neat when I think about it like that. 

Ryan: You give the phrase a real meaning, right? 

Ryan: Like these families are meeting the guy, 

Ryan: putting the roof above their head. 

Ryan: Yeah, yeah. And 

Ryan: I talk about that a lot nowadays and say, you know. 

Ryan: What do you say? 

Ryan: Well, the homeowner, you know, they'll approach us or even the builder, 

Ryan: even if it's not the homeowner, if they're not present, 

Ryan: you know, wow, this is great. 

Ryan: It's amazing how much you guys got done. 

Ryan: I'll always turn that into, yeah, you got a great roof. 

Ryan: You know, see all these hips and valleys and yeah, usually have no idea 

Ryan: what I'm talking about, but I love to engage them 

Ryan: and show them like walk around the house and say, you know, that's an irregular hip 

Ryan: and that's an irregular valley. 

Ryan: And this roof's incredibly of multiple pitches. 

Ryan: And this area here, we was difficult for us. 

Ryan: And so I give them kind of a sense of, 

Ryan: oh, wow, there's a lot that probably goes into this 

Ryan: that we didn't realize, you know, which I think that's important for all people. 

Ryan: We all need to appreciate one another. 

Ryan: You know, when, when, when you get hurt, you go and put all of your trust 

Ryan: into a nurse or a doctor without even thinking about it. 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: We all need to be like that in the trades. 

Ryan: I trust that, you know, the foundation guy is going to do his job 

Ryan: accordingly and then, you know, they're trusting that we're going to put 

Ryan: a structural house that's structurally sound on top of that. 

Ryan: And then all the trades that follow suit. 

Ryan: And I think we all need to help each other. 

Ryan: If there's something you can do to make it easy for the next guy coming in. 

Ryan: Right? 

Ryan: Why wouldn't we do that? 

Ryan: But yeah, I really enjoy conversing with homeowners. 

Ryan: The the excitement that they share. 

Ryan: It's the little things you kind of lock away, put them in your pocket. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: It's always usually a good experience. 

Ryan: You're describing something that, you know, I've been encountering 

Ryan: while making these courses, which is, um, 

Ryan: just how much goes into each trade. 

Ryan: But I do feel like roofing in particular, especially reframing 

Ryan: like literally no idea. 

Ryan: Like there's so much and 

Ryan: oh yeah, the average person to understanding 

Ryan: the complexity is like, why is that so to reframing. 

Ryan: Well, I think the biggest reason it's 

Ryan: even in our own trade, trade specific 

Ryan: to framing carpentry is the onset of roof trusses. 

Ryan: They've been around for 30 or 40 years, 

Ryan: I would have to guess, not really sure, but they've been around my entire career, 

Ryan: so I feel like that's kind of killed our craft in a way. 

Ryan: There's career long framing carpenters who may feel 

Ryan: the same way I do about what they do, but they've never had the opportunity 

Ryan: to do it in the 

Ryan: old fashioned way or stick framing, as we call it, 

Ryan: because it just wasn't the way it was done in their area. 

Ryan: So I think a lot of light isn't 

Ryan: shed on what we do because it was more popular 

Ryan: 50 years ago. 

Ryan: To me, everything about a stick frame roof is better 

Ryan: than a manufactured truss. 

Ryan: That's an argument I've with lumber salesmen 

Ryan: and other carpenters, you know, social media. 

Ryan: Gosh. 

Ryan: But it has taken 

Ryan: it has removed the craftsman portion 

Ryan: from that step and framing a house everything up until that point 

Ryan: is the same. 

Ryan: But a truss crew knows when they get to second floor walls 

Ryan: or if it's a ranch when they're done with walls, that the trust company 

Ryan: will drop off their trusses 

Ryan: and they'll run a crane and they'll just set the whole roof 

Ryan: ceiling included where we're rolling our ceiling 

Ryan: and nailing them to each wall and making all of the cuts. 

Ryan: So there's there's a lot more involved. 

Ryan: When you stick frame, you're responsible for the length of every board. 

Ryan: Nothing is being provided. 

Ryan: It's a pile of sticks on day one. 

Ryan: And at the end, you know, 

Ryan: you have a recreation of the blueprint that you've been using all along. 

Ryan: So I'm grateful for that. If 

Ryan: if trusses come in and take over, I'm out. 

Ryan: I'll move. 

Ryan: I'll have to follow where the stick framing is. 

Ryan: There's no doubt about it. 

Ryan: It's just part of who I am. 

Ryan: So I think that's the biggest probably reason 

Ryan: it's not so appreciated anymore. 

Ryan: Which is kind of like, you know, the age old narrative of technology, right? 

Ryan: Yeah, exactly. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Sometimes 

Ryan: new isn't always better or, 

Ryan: you know, the other the other side of the fence, as they say. 

Ryan: The idea I admire, I think it's great, which it's really what we're doing here 

Ryan: in this inside the shop where prefab and around pre cutting the roof 

Ryan: so we are actually faster stick framing the roof 

Ryan: than we are having trusses and we've proven this quite a few times. 

Ryan: We don't use trusses often. 

Ryan: Sometimes there's no way around it. 

Ryan: It was the house was drawn that way. 

Ryan: The architect, the way the house was engineered, 

Ryan: they just don't want to switch it to rafters and we need the work. 

Ryan: So we take the job. 

Ryan: Those ones are 

Ryan: always a bummer for me, but you know, you got to do what you have to do. 

Ryan: We are markedly faster stick framing. 

Ryan: I would put us against any truss screw if I have everything cut, we're ready. 

Ryan: They have trusses on the ground. They're ready. 

Ryan: I bet you we're done first. 

Ryan: I would argue that all day long I would. 

Ryan: So the idea of trusses and pre-made, you know, in getting it to that level, 

Ryan: that's really what we're doing here. 

Ryan: We're just keeping the craftsmanship in it. 

Ryan: We're not relying on another company. 

Ryan: We're kind of keeping it in-house. 

Ryan: So yeah. 

Ryan: The other cool thing too is like we've had a chance to see how you apply 

Ryan: your own creative signature, you know, in subtle ways, but really, 

Ryan: you know, important ways both to you and to the people that you work with. 

Ryan: And you see your work. 

Ryan: You talk about, you know, how, how you build your own signature. 

Ryan: Yeah, I think, you know, it all stemmed 

Ryan: from that passion about it all. 

Ryan: You know, 

Ryan: you take something to a certain level as a person no matter what. 

Ryan: It is right for you. 

Ryan: If you're a musician, you're going to get to a point where you feel like, 

Ryan: Hey, I'm getting pretty good. 

Ryan: You know, I'm almost mastering this. 

Ryan: Do we complacent? 

Ryan: Do we stop there? 

Ryan: Do we keep reaching? 

Ryan: We always want to be better, right? 

Ryan: If if you feel that strongly about something, 

Ryan: it's an endless journey of learning about what 

Ryan: what what it is you're actually doing as well as learning about yourself. 

Ryan: So I think some of the little things that I do in regards to my cutting 

Ryan: and roof framing were just that, you know, hey, I've I've cut 

Ryan: 20,000 hip rafters. 

Ryan: How can I cut them differently to spice things up? 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: So I started figuring out and playing with, 

Ryan: you know, edge the and backing my shoulders. 

Ryan: So now I do that and I'm asked that question all the time, you know, 

Ryan: isn't that a waste of time? 

Ryan: You know, time is money. 

Ryan: I could have had that hip cut and nailed. 

Ryan: Yeah, maybe. 

Ryan: If maybe if you're, like, the fastest person in the world. 

Ryan: But I, I've demonstrated for you that it literally takes 

Ryan: just a few moments and the end results better. 

Ryan: And then the argument is, well, no one will ever see it. 

Ryan: You're going to cover it with plywood and then shingles and yeah, you're right. 

Ryan: You're absolutely right. 

Ryan: If that's if that's the angle you want to look at it from, fine. 

Ryan: I feel sorry for you. 

Ryan: I look at it as I spent my time away from 

Ryan: my wife and my children and everything that I love. 

Ryan: Cutting this roof. 

Ryan: I'm going to make it worth my while, you know, it makes me happy to do it. 

Ryan: So I do it up ridge boards. 

Ryan: I rip the crown out of all the ridge boards. 

Ryan: Even if I look at the ridge 

Ryan: and it's perfectly straight now, I just I have to make that cut. 

Ryan: It's just that one extra little thing 

Ryan: that makes me feel wholesome about what I'm doing. 

Ryan: So I think that, you know, those little things just came from, 

Ryan: hey, what can I do a little bit more, you know, now? 

Ryan: And, and as of lately, I've started wondering and I've even on a few roofs, 

Ryan: I've beveled the hips or the I'm sorry, the ridges. 

Ryan: So I'll have the ridge cut the pitch, cut into the ridge, which is, 

Ryan: you know, I like that I've been doing that more and more. 

Ryan: And then all the way down to the overhang, I've contemplated, 

Ryan: Hey, when I have the roof, maybe I'll have all the fascia material 

Ryan: and I can bevel it all. 

Ryan: So it matches the roof slope, right. 

Ryan: Really take it that far, which I'll probably try. 

Ryan: I have done it here and there on small things just to just to kind of see it. 

Ryan: And, you know, if it's, 

Ryan: if it's something that 

Ryan: I don't mind doing 

Ryan: or even if it takes a little longer, I'll spend the time, the extra time 

Ryan: just to make it so, you know, it doesn't really affect my productivity. 

Ryan: But every board I cut, I try to cut perfectly and I can't. 

Ryan: So that's fun to try to always be perfect 

Ryan: and we all know that's impossible, but it is fun to try. 

Ryan: So those little things, they just keep me happy. 

Ryan: That's kind of. It. 

Ryan: I mean, you know, it's an extension of you. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: It's a way to express yourself, 

Ryan: you know, a lot of the guys, when I first started 

Ryan: doing it on on our crew or, you know, 

Ryan: at first, why why did you do that? 

Ryan: You know, speaking about hips and valleys and I don't know, because I can 

Ryan: because I wanted to look straight, you know, and through time, over 

Ryan: time of putting all these roofs together, same group of guys for so long. 

Ryan: They love it now, too, because it it helps them do their job better 

Ryan: because those pain points are there right there. 

Ryan: There's no question they're not citing a Jack 

Ryan: Rafter to the center of a square shouldered valley rafter. 

Ryan: I've plowed it out for them. 

Ryan: So they just line up the edge, few nails onto the next one. So 

Ryan: it's kind of yeah, that's just the way we do it now. 

Ryan: I'll never not do it that way. 

Ryan: Now, at this point, yeah. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: I mean, like, why not put your mark on something that is 

Ryan: an extension of you. Exactly. 

Ryan: Why not. That makes you happy. 

Ryan: That's what I say. If it makes you happy, do it. 

Ryan: We only get so many trips around the sun, so do what makes you happy 

Ryan: for sure and enjoy the ride, right? 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: And the 

Ryan: you were touching on a point earlier 

Ryan: that I want to keep rolling on the 

Ryan: custom stick framing with. Um, 

Ryan: you know, it's, it's, it's, it's the reason we're here. 

Ryan: It's like process. 

Ryan: And, you know, we've talked throughout the week about how kind of 

Ryan: limited 

Ryan: conversation and access to that knowledge is. 

Ryan: But you've taken an initiative to share 

Ryan: what you know, like, you know, from, from within. You. 

Ryan: You've just self started 

Ryan: educating the masses out of 

Ryan: I think a passion for what you do, but also have a passion to, 

Ryan: to share the knowledge, 

Ryan: you know, I mean, you know, I'm talking definitely about your Instagram account. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: And you know, the last five days have, um, have shown that, um, 

Ryan: you know, you have a natural penchant for teaching. 

Ryan: So that means a. 

Ryan: Lot like what, you know, what education 

Ryan: and sharing the knowledge of this trade. 

Ryan: You got started doing that. 

Ryan: So it was, you know, it was pretty clear to me the older I got, 

Ryan: you know, and I got more savvy with electronics 

Ryan: and our cell phones and there's social media and YouTube 

Ryan: and Instagram and Facebook and there's there's ways to connect 

Ryan: now that we didn't have when I started in this industry. So 

Ryan: I started realizing fairly quickly that, 

Ryan: wow, you are doing something a little different 

Ryan: than what everyone else is doing, or at least what I had found, 

Ryan: which then turned into, you know, I'd have 

Ryan: private messages 

Ryan: sent to me or emails question, you know, with questions regarding roof framing. 

Ryan: And I thought, could it be 

Ryan: could someone really care what I thought or how I do this? 

Ryan: And that became more apparent the more I started putting myself out there. 

Ryan: So I've tried to teach 

Ryan: as much as I can. 

Ryan: It's it's hard to find the time which I've been working on, 

Ryan: and I've been recording my own videos for some time now, very poorly 

Ryan: in comparison to what I've learned this week here with this has just been 

Ryan: my dream come true. 

Ryan: Explaining what you do 

Ryan: isn't always the easiest thing. 

Ryan: It's kind of like stream of consciousness. 

Ryan: That's right. 

Ryan: So when you're really in the moment and you're doing what you do, 

Ryan: I can explain it much easier than if I'm at a picnic table or having a picnic. 

Ryan: And some guy asks me, Hey, how do you, you know, lay out a hip rafter? 

Ryan: I could still get through it. 

Ryan: But most of the stuff that I've tried to teach has been basic stuff. 

Ryan: I've shared some more complicated things 

Ryan: as of lately. 

Ryan: I hope 

Ryan: that I'm received well. 

Ryan: It's, you know, it's it's it's had its ups and downs. 

Ryan: I do enjoy teaching. 

Ryan: I don't get enough feedback. 

Ryan: I get a lot of positive feedback. 

Ryan: I get a lot of negative feedback. 

Ryan: You know, you could cure cancer. 

Ryan: They're going to find a reason to hate you. 

Ryan: So that's been kind of what it is. 

Ryan: Whatever there's there's a lot of other amazing 

Ryan: people that I see every day 

Ryan: and Instagram, Facebook, that it's just very humbling 

Ryan: to see how talented and passionate other people are. 

Ryan: So if I could have a small piece of helping other people 

Ryan: progress with 

Ryan: reframing or framing in general, 

Ryan: that would be the biggest honor to me. 

Ryan: I would feel like 

Ryan: I kind of left my mark, you know, 

Ryan: as they say, you can't keep your trade until you give it away. 

Ryan: So I'm all about the education. 

Ryan: There wasn't there wasn't a lot there for me 

Ryan: growing up to learn from unless I found, you know, a book published 

Ryan: 30 years prior and at that point, the game had changed so much. 

Ryan: We haven't really kept the trades up to speed, at least mine. 

Ryan: I mean, we, we drive nails with hammers. 

Ryan: So it's not really and you need to wear a helmet. 

Ryan: So it's not like you have to be a rocket scientist. 

Ryan: But what we do, it's been it hasn't changed, as you said, shelter. 

Ryan: So while you know, the tools have improved and our materials, 

Ryan: the techniques are starting to come around. 

Ryan: And I feel 

Ryan: most of the trade education 

Ryan: in regards to framing is material 

Ryan: kind of related. 

Ryan: Hey, we have new sheathing out. 

Ryan: This is how we do it. 

Ryan: The techniques in which we use 

Ryan: to get a structure built have really not changed. 

Ryan: We have some we have nail guns now. 

Ryan: We, you know, we use air, we have battery powered guns, cordless saws. 

Ryan: All of that has come a long way. 

Ryan: And I feel like the education was focused towards that, more 

Ryan: so than how do we 

Ryan: actually do, 

Ryan: right? 

Ryan: So I learned on the job site, right, 

Ryan: late nineties, early, thousands making mistakes, getting yelled at. 

Ryan: You know, I always was afraid to let my my boss down 

Ryan: if he showed me that I did something poorly. 

Ryan: When he made that apparent, 

Ryan: it bothered me. 

Ryan: You know, I was like, it's like when you're a young boy and your 

Ryan: your father comes down on you and he yells that you feel bad. 

Ryan: That's how it was for me. 

Ryan: I always wanted to make my employer happy 

Ryan: and I wanted to be prideful in my work, and I figured that out pretty quickly. 

Ryan: So I kind of fell into place and moved my way up 

Ryan: through the ranks, just through old fashioned hard work. 

Ryan: So you don't have to. 

Ryan: Not everyone has to go to college. 

Ryan: We need mechanics. 

Ryan: We need carpenters and plumbers and AC guys 

Ryan: and electricians and concrete guys and arborists. 

Ryan: I mean, it's okay to work with your hands. 

Ryan: In fact, I find it extremely rewarding. 

Ryan: With that being said, a lot of jobs, you do have to go to college 

Ryan: because there's a lot there. 

Ryan: There's a lot to know. What we what we do is 

Ryan: much, much easier on many levels. 

Ryan: But it takes years to learn. 

Ryan: It does and to teach and share in that 

Ryan: hopefully will give the younger generations 

Ryan: coming up, you know, a jumpstart. 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: I mean, my my oldest son, he just turned 14. 

Ryan: He loves coming to work with dad. 

Ryan: You know, he likes to have a little money in his pocket. 

Ryan: He's interested. 

Ryan: He's that similar type of mind that I have, 

Ryan: and I'm not going to push him to go to college. 

Ryan: I tell him, you do what you want to do. 

Ryan: If you want to, you want to go that route, that's fine if you want to. 

Ryan: You know, I'm not going to say I want a different life for you. 

Ryan: Obviously, I want the best of everything for my children. 

Ryan: But I also know how rewarding 

Ryan: it's been for me, despite the challenges and the hard times. 

Ryan: That's okay because life always easy. 

Ryan: And to simply make decisions based on 

Ryan: how easy it will make your life 

Ryan: to me is a total wrong approach. 

Ryan: I say, as I mentioned before, do what you like to do. 

Ryan: Hey, if you enjoy this, you know, whatever that may be, 

Ryan: but you can go over here and do this and make a little bit more money. 

Ryan: That, to me, that's 

Ryan: that's a no brainer. 

Ryan: Do what you love, you know, to be a happier person. 

Ryan: And that's my approach with what these younger guys we have some on our cruise 

Ryan: now. I try to infect them 

Ryan: with the passion and feeling it gives me to be there. 

Ryan: You know, they've been on the job site for two weeks without me. 

Ryan: Here comes the rafters. They show up, right? 

Ryan: Oh, Ryan's here. My tool belt. 

Ryan: And here we go, you know. Hey, how you doing? 

Ryan: Hi. I'm saying hello to everybody. 

Ryan: I try to grab those, you know, younger the older teens and the younger twenties 

Ryan: and sit with them on launch and, you know, try to make them think that roof 

Ryan: framing is the absolute most amazing thing in the world, 

Ryan: because I want to, in fact, them with that. 

Ryan: I want them to stay. 

Ryan: Hey, we need to help be there, a certain type of person to still be here. 

Ryan: So I want them to look at a man my age and say, 

Ryan: wow, he really still likes this. 

Ryan: He loves it like either this guy is cuckoo or maybe I've made the right decision. 

Ryan: Maybe I'll see it through. 

Ryan: Maybe I'll stick with this. 

Ryan: You know, he seems to enjoy it. 

Ryan: He seems happy. 

Ryan: So I think that's all with the teaching and the 

Ryan: in the sharing, you know, like we're doing here, 

Ryan: I think that is the future. 

Ryan: I really do. 

Ryan: And the trades need it more than ever. 

Ryan: They really do. 

Ryan: I think a key point that you kind of alluded to as well is that 

Ryan: an individual's intelligence is not 

Ryan: measured by acknowledges degrees. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Like I don't know, I'm racking my brain all week to see if I, 

Ryan: you know, anybody who could 

Ryan: calculate and care to the degree that you do. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: So mean you guys have made that evident to me as well. 

Ryan: That's back to the appreciation of what others do. 

Ryan: I mean, people are amazing, but 

Ryan: when I graduated high school in 1999, 

Ryan: you know, they had career day and all these career fairs, 

Ryan: there wasn't a bricklayer there or an electrician 

Ryan: or a framing carpenter, probably because they just couldn't leave the job. 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: There's always a lot of work. There's so much work to do all the time. 

Ryan: But it almost felt like 

Ryan: if I didn't go to college, 

Ryan: I would be not received the same or maybe even looked down upon. 

Ryan: And that's a tough stigma. 

Ryan: You know, 

Ryan: I don't appreciate 

Ryan: the phrase I work in construction. 

Ryan: I think that's too generalized. 

Ryan: When I hear that, I'll say, Oh, what do you do? 

Ryan: Well, you know, I'm a mason. 

Ryan: I said, Well, you don't work in construction. 

Ryan: You're an artist, right? 

Ryan: That's some of my I told you earlier this week some some of my favorite lunch 

Ryan: breaks are where there's a crew of Masons in the line of sight for me. 

Ryan: And can eat my lunch and watch them lay bricks or stack stones. 

Ryan: It's just fascinating to me. 

Ryan: And then I'll go over, maybe even introduce myself, say hello. 

Ryan: Sometimes I'll eat lunch with them 

Ryan: or I'll wait till they leave and I'll go over and look at their work. 

Ryan: And it's you know, I have a deep appreciation for the trades because work in them. 

Ryan: You guys have given me 

Ryan: so much. 

Ryan: It's been it's been humbling to see what 

Ryan: took place here this week and the thought processes. 

Ryan: And as you said, you can tell that I care about what I do 

Ryan: and I feel the same exact way about you guys. 

Ryan: It's been you all seem to enjoy it. 

Ryan: Happy every day you're creating 

Ryan: educational videos that are going to make 

Ryan: an absolute necessity. 

Ryan: As we stated, human shelter. Right? 

Ryan: It's going to bring it more to light 

Ryan: and hopefully bring more people in because we need that 

Ryan: and hopefully that continues to happen. 

Ryan: What does it. 

Ryan: Take to be a good student? 

Ryan: To be a good student 

Ryan: for me is all about attitude. 

Ryan: It's not, you know, I don't need you to show me how smart you are. 

Ryan: I need you to show me that you're eager to learn. 

Ryan: You're listening. 

Ryan: You have to be a good listener and you have to be really good 

Ryan: at making mistakes. 

Ryan: Meaning, if you don't make any mistakes, 

Ryan: I'm going to start wondering why we're even in front of each other. 

Ryan: Right? So 

Ryan: to ask questions 

Ryan: and then I like to see the lights go off. 

Ryan: And it's happened several times for me, 

Ryan: being a good student, 

Ryan: I think you just need to have the right amount of interest, right? 

Ryan: It's hard for me to learn about something that's not interesting. 

Ryan: If I'm interested in something and I read about it 

Ryan: or I listen to someone talk about it, 

Ryan: I'll take a certain level of knowledge away. 

Ryan: If I'm sitting in something that's boring to me, you know, 

Ryan: I won't remember as much. 

Ryan: So I think, I think to be a really good student, you have to be interested 

Ryan: A, B, you have to have a good attitude, meaning you have to be positive. 

Ryan: You have to be able to receive criticism, constructive criticism. 

Ryan: You kind of have to leave your feelings out of it. 

Ryan: Or maybe old habits is, if I'm responsible for teaching you, I want you. 

Ryan: I'm inviting you to try and think along with me. 

Ryan: Now there's 100 other ways to do exactly what I do, but I want to show you my way. 

Ryan: I want you to absorb that. 

Ryan: And then I'm willing to have the conversation of, Hey, 

Ryan: well, we can try it like this or like that. 

Ryan: And through that could come personal growth 

Ryan: for both the teacher and the student, 

Ryan: because it's not certainly my way or the highway, right? 

Ryan: There's always things to learn, which I mentioned earlier. 

Ryan: I'm still learning every day. 

Ryan: So that's a big point to me. 

Ryan: Be available. 

Ryan: Listen, have a good attitude and you have to have interest and 

Ryan: you have to spend the time. 

Ryan: That's the biggest thing. 

Ryan: When all is said and done and say your lesson is done for the day 

Ryan: or what have you, and you're back home is to keep it going. 

Ryan: Keep thinking about it, keep studying it, keep practicing it. 

Ryan: That's that's what I did for many years in my garage, you know, at night. 

Ryan: So there's got to be a hunger there to be a good student, in my mind. 

Ryan: At least that's for me. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: I mean, it's, it's, you know, I mean, at least you embody it. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Yeah, I appreciate that. 

Ryan: And I check my notes real quick here. 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: But, but also I have done it. 

Ryan: That's on your mind. 

Ryan: Kind of upside 

Ryan: down. 

Ryan: That's my boss falling asleep. 

Ryan: Yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: I got a couple more 

Ryan: cameras. 

Ryan: All good. 

Ryan: Rolling, rolling. 

Ryan: Joey's upside down. 

Ryan: Now. That's all right. I can talk to you upside down. 

Ryan: You know what I mean? 

Ryan: Like you said, you get it. But, yeah. 

Ryan: You know what I look like from every angle, probably. 

Ryan: Oh, yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: Look good, bro. Like T-shirts, man. 

Ryan: They're thinning. 

Ryan: Oh, man. Um, 

Ryan: cool. 

Ryan: Everybody get set. Go. 

Ryan: What? 

Ryan: What's your biggest hope in? 

Ryan: What do you hope that today's carpenters take away from what? 

Ryan: We've just been learning about it with that group? 

Ryan: I think the biggest thing, 

Ryan: my biggest hope for what 

Ryan: a future student may take away from 

Ryan: this is not even necessarily learning 

Ryan: and being better at what they do, 

Ryan: as much as being passionate about what they do. 

Ryan: A particularly 

Ryan: shitty car. 

Ryan: Okay, but we're right. 

Ryan: Thank you. 

Ryan: My biggest hope for the students that may take this is 

Ryan: for obvious reasons, the education and getting better. 

Ryan: But more importantly would be to 

Ryan: maybe be more passionate, maybe 

Ryan: feel what I've shared for themselves, because I think it takes a level 

Ryan: of passion and intensity to get better at things. 

Ryan: Right? 

Ryan: I mean, practice makes perfect, as they say. 

Ryan: To have a level of passion about something makes the practice easier, right? 

Ryan: You're not so afraid when when you make mistakes 

Ryan: or when it takes you longer to understand something, 

Ryan: you're still hungry for it because you're because of the passion. 

Ryan: So it kind of keeps you motivated. 

Ryan: It's sort of the the gas in the tank for me. 

Ryan: You know, when I have I have difficult days sometimes 

Ryan: for whatever reason was a long week with with my children or my family and 

Ryan: I got a lot of things going on outside of work. 

Ryan: And when I come to do what I do, it's 

Ryan: a lot easier for me to push all that away and focus on 

Ryan: what I'm doing because I genuinely enjoy it. 

Ryan: So more importantly, I hope that I've conveyed that 

Ryan: through our lessons. 

Ryan: I do want them to understand and learn. 

Ryan: It would be really cool to see a whole bunch of companies 

Ryan: out there pretty cutting roofs that would be like the ultimate honor. 

Ryan: It would be mind bending. 

Ryan: And I'm confident that, 

Ryan: you know, with the techniques that I've shown, that that's 

Ryan: probably not so far out of reach for a lot of guys that are very close. 

Ryan: And for those that are kind of new to this, 

Ryan: well, you're going to have a leg up on me because this took many years 

Ryan: to figure out. 

Ryan: So for me to share that is, again, an honor. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Another thing I feel like I've learned this week is like, 

Ryan: I mean, you build the roof up here. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: I mean, cutting was cool to see, but, like, 

Ryan: I feel like we watched you build a roof, you know, in your mind. 

Ryan: Oh, yeah. 

Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. The roof. 

Ryan: It's always there. It's always in your head. 

Ryan: Speaking from a roof color, uh, standpoint, that's 

Ryan: I, I think we're maybe 

Ryan: I don't want to use the term a rare breed or a dying breed, 

Ryan: but I think there's some value and some truth to that. 

Ryan: Now, it's not interesting to everybody. 

Ryan: So framing carpenters generally that I that I know in my personal life 

Ryan: and have seen on social media platforms, everybody enjoys the roof. 

Ryan: That's the only part that's different. 

Ryan: So yeah, you build it. 

Ryan: You build it first few times, quite a few times. 

Ryan: It's always there. 

Ryan: Um, and then the next drawing comes in 

Ryan: and that roof you just finished, kind of it doesn't go away. 

Ryan: It still creeps back in. 

Ryan: You'll notice similarities with the next house. 

Ryan: Certain numbers will jump out and you'll say, Hey, that was 

Ryan: that was the same span from two roofs ago or the last roof. 

Ryan: So it's kind of always lingering. 

Ryan: And it seems like the file cabinet will hold several, three 

Ryan: or four roofs at a time some mornings I'll come in. I 

Ryan: finally got a hold and then I morning. 

Ryan: Some mornings I'll come in to the shop during the cutting phase 

Ryan: and I'll set up my gauges on my square to a pitch from two or three roofs ago. 

Ryan: It's just still in my mind, you know. 

Ryan: So a lot of little things like that. 

Ryan: I always chuckle at myself. 

Ryan: I'll remember a certain dimension for weeks. 

Ryan: We'll be eating dinner at home, thinking about, you know, 33 foot 

Ryan: five and 5/8, because that was a span that was so important to me 

Ryan: that we got right because it affected so many other parts 

Ryan: that it just kind of burned into my brain for, you know, a small time. 

Ryan: But yeah, it's definitely very, very mental 

Ryan: sort of a profession or task. 

Ryan: What does that breakdown like that? 

Ryan: Like how how much mental, how much physical. 

Ryan: What Well, it's both. Yes, it's 

Ryan: it's very I don't want to use 

Ryan: the term taxing because I enjoy it, but it is it's stressful, right? 

Ryan: I mean, the stakes are high you've you have 

Ryan: thousands of dollars of material 

Ryan: that you're responsible for cutting 

Ryan: and that brings its own level of stress. 

Ryan: However, at this point, you have a level of confidence 

Ryan: that it's going to work. 

Ryan: You've done it time and time again. 

Ryan: However, with that being said, I'm never comfortable. 

Ryan: Always 

Ryan: I'm comfortable in my 

Ryan: SO then it becomes monitoring myself. 

Ryan: And how focused are you? 

Ryan: For example, 

Ryan: as I mentioned earlier, when I'm in the calculating process, 

Ryan: I'll sit at this drawing table for hours, several days. 

Ryan: Sometimes I will find myself drifting out of what I'm doing. 

Ryan: I'm doing it, I'm hitting my calculator, I'm filling up my notebook, 

Ryan: and I'll be thinking about something else. 

Ryan: I have to get up. 

Ryan: I'll pace around the shop for 20 minutes. 

Ryan: I'll go outside some fresh air. 

Ryan: Sit down for a minute, then I'll come back to it. 

Ryan: I'll double check what I was working on. 

Ryan: Sometimes I find mistakes and I say, 

Ryan: Well, boy, I'm glad that you, you know, you took a break because I would have 

Ryan: I would have been bad guys want to let you live that down. 

Ryan: The mistakes are never huge 

Ryan: because of the way I've laid this system out. 

Ryan: It's hard to not catch them. 

Ryan: You know, that's from day one, going out to the job, transferring 

Ryan: the marks over to the blueprints, handing that over to the crew. 

Ryan: All of those things ensure it's a double 

Ryan: check, triple check the whole way. So 

Ryan: but it's very stressful, 

Ryan: but it's a good stress because it's fun. 

Ryan: So and I think people by nature 

Ryan: always perform better under pressure that it's easy. 

Ryan: You don't try as hard right if you get up to the plate and you know 

Ryan: you're going to hit a homerun every time, how boring would that be? 

Ryan: Would be boring. 

Ryan: So that that stress is okay. 

Ryan: And I like kind of having a fire underneath me. 

Ryan: He keeps me, keeps me sharp. 

Ryan: That I mean, that's a great I mean, you almost answer my next question 

Ryan: are you did answering my next question, which is basically like, 

Ryan: you know, like I just think of like this as being like a very, 

Ryan: very pressure ful situation, you know, like roofing, a lot of pressure. 

Ryan: I mean, there's a lot of money. There's a lot at stake. 

Ryan: Like you said, um, it's got to work and it's got to fit. 

Ryan: And so, like, my question would be like, how do you handle that pressure? 

Ryan: And I think it's, you know, 

Ryan: certainly the methodology 

Ryan: that yeah, it's almost like you've learned to rely on yourself 

Ryan: and you have to rely on the math and your experience. 

Ryan: So I'm wondering if you can 

Ryan: just talk about like how you handle 

Ryan: pressure, how you handle that stress. 

Ryan: So yeah, 

Ryan: there is a lot at stake and the pressures are 

Ryan: a lot. 

Ryan: It's not always easy. 

Ryan: Sometimes that puts me in. 

Ryan: I don't want to say a bad mood, but I'm a human. 

Ryan: A bad mood, right? 

Ryan: I come home after a long day and or the weather was bad or for what I or I. 

Ryan: I made a big mistake. 

Ryan: And I'm my own worst critic, so 

Ryan: it's not always easy. But 

Ryan: as interesting as it may sound, 

Ryan: it's kind of a self-reliant, 

Ryan: self-soothing, sort of coping mechanism. 

Ryan: I feel most comfortable when my tool belt is on, 

Ryan: when I'm staring at a roof plan or I have a sore on my hands SO 

Ryan: I may carry those stresses home with me for one night. 

Ryan: But the very next morning when I have the radio going 

Ryan: and I'm cutting or whatever it is, it just kind of all goes away. 

Ryan: And I fall right back into that feeling of 

Ryan: of passion and, you know, that drive to 

Ryan: to really push yourself and 

Ryan: handling stress is different for everyone. 

Ryan: My kids keep me pretty busy, so I don't really I don't have a lot of time 

Ryan: to feel stress when I live here, so 

Ryan: I kind of handle it and burn it off at the same time. 

Ryan: As I said, if I, if I, if I notice I've miscalculated something 

Ryan: and I didn't catch it for like a whole section of roof. 

Ryan: And there it is. 

Ryan: It shows up and I'm like, Wait a minute, that should be this. Or 

Ryan: I'll get 

Ryan: up and I'll pace around and I'm like, That's a bummer. 

Ryan: I'll have to use an eraser, you know, big deal. 

Ryan: It's not like everything's cut at that point. 

Ryan: So the stress is kind of gone after 

Ryan: I've began cutting because I have double, triple checked everything. 

Ryan: Now I'll make I'll make human errors during the cutting. 

Ryan: I'll, I'll cut the wrong bevel or I'll cut it backwards, things like that. 

Ryan: That's always going to happen. 

Ryan: I mean, there's hundreds of rafters on every house. 

Ryan: And I think, as I mentioned in one of my courses, 

Ryan: I've never got 100% on a roof, 

Ryan: a lot of nineties, upper nineties, but I have never aced one, so to say. 

Ryan: And I like that because as said, how how boring would that be 

Ryan: if every time it was just perfect it wouldn't be any fun, you know? 

Ryan: And every time I cut a roof I leave the shop, I turn the light off. 

Ryan: I know tomorrow we're delivering it. 

Ryan: I think I got 100. 

Ryan: So then I get excited and eager and we started putting the roof together 

Ryan: and we've gotten them together down to like the last 20 rafters. 

Ryan: And sure enough, 

Ryan: hey, you got the bubbles backwards on these three jacks, right now. 

Ryan: See, I just can't get one right, 

Ryan: but it's an easy 

Ryan: fix, you know, we just switch the bubbles. And 

Ryan: so, yeah, it's 

Ryan: if you follow the system that I've they've shared 

Ryan: the stress. 

Ryan: The stress will be there the whole time. 

Ryan: But The more you understand it, the more efficient 

Ryan: you're going to be at it. 

Ryan: And I'm telling you, I make mistakes, okay? 

Ryan: We just have to be 

Ryan: concise about what we're doing. 

Ryan: We have to be focused, okay? 

Ryan: You can't you can't be somewhere else mentally. 

Ryan: You have to be ready to sit down and focus on what you're doing. 

Ryan: I think so. 

Ryan: I guess the long answer, short answer of all that is 

Ryan: I handle my stress with stress, if that makes sense. 

Ryan: It stresses me out to be stressed out. 

Ryan: So I go to work and I feel better. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: I mean, you plan, your plan or do. 

Ryan: I play a guitar? 

Ryan: That's what I should have said if I. 

Ryan: What I heard here was if you're stressed at work, have kids. 

Ryan: Yeah, yes, have kids. 

Ryan: The more the merrier. I love kids. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Most important part of my life. 

Ryan: Yeah. 

Ryan: Stress is, you know, that's different for everyone. 

Ryan: So that's a that's a tough one to answer. 

Ryan: I'd like to tell you, I you know, I'll just I'll go home 

Ryan: and I'll crush a 30 pack of beer and I feel way better. 

Ryan: Yeah, right. 

Ryan: So cool. 

Ryan: Yeah, I've got I've got one, one kind of last question in my head 

Ryan: and feel free to riff on anything that we haven't touched on. 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: Um, you know, you were talking a little bit earlier throughout the week, 

Ryan: you know that, um, you know, some, sometimes our ideas of success and any in 

Ryan: anything that we do is fortune 

Ryan: and fame and the biggest and best and top of the top dog. 

Ryan: That is better off, too, but I love how you were describing 

Ryan: kind of like the modified vision for for your for your life, 

Ryan: your career and your legacy, which is basically where you're at. 

Ryan: So I'd love to hear more about like how you, how you define success, um, 

Ryan: and what you do and kind of the hopes for your legacy. 

Ryan: I think 

Ryan: success, 

Ryan: you know, being a successful person, 

Ryan: that's perceived many different ways. 

Ryan: Some people being successful is you have $1,000,000 

Ryan: in the bank and some people are more simple. 

Ryan: Being successful to others is I have a hot meal on the table today. 

Ryan: That's a pretty broad spectrum. 

Ryan: I guess my take on success, 

Ryan: I guess my take on success, 

Ryan: there's many levels of it 

Ryan: to speak directly towards framing. 

Ryan: Carpenter 

Ryan: Don't fall into that 

Ryan: thought or ideal that for me to be successful, 

Ryan: I need to own my own framing company. 

Ryan: I need to be the boss, I need to have 15 trucks and I want a TV commercial. 

Ryan: So that's great. 

Ryan: If you get to that level, that is certainly successful. 

Ryan: But I won't respect you anymore. 

Ryan: Then I'll respect the 35 year old man 

Ryan: who's came to work every day and he's the top dog on that job site. 

Ryan: He may not own the company. 

Ryan: That's not what impresses me. 

Ryan: What impresses me about that other guy 

Ryan: is he has the wherewithal and the know how and he shows his passion. 

Ryan: To me that is successful. 

Ryan: I don't think there's a ceiling, 

Ryan: if you will, on the ladder of success 

Ryan: in the in our framing world. 

Ryan: I think that can be looked at many different ways. 

Ryan: If money is your end goal, then that's how you will measure your success. 

Ryan: If knowledge and understanding is your end goal, then 

Ryan: that'll be your skill for success. 

Ryan: I tend not to judge a book by its cover because I've met some interesting people 

Ryan: in this line of work every walk of life, as I've mentioned so 

Ryan: I think there's small triumphs every day 

Ryan: that we should all recognize when they happen. 

Ryan: Kind of throw that in your bag of life 

Ryan: experience, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. 

Ryan: That's the other thing 

Ryan: to me. 

Ryan: I feel 

Ryan: successful. 

Ryan: I as a carpenter, I, 

Ryan: I was interested in reframing my whole career. 

Ryan: I've I've brought myself to a level 

Ryan: that I never thought I would ever get to. 

Ryan: And now I have this opportunity to share this with hopefully many others. 

Ryan: To me 

Ryan: you couldn't put a price on that. 

Ryan: So I think successes 

Ryan: there's levels of it and it's just a 

Ryan: it's a way of thinking like like I said in my course, you know, 

Ryan: yeah, money and fame and fortune and being popular, 

Ryan: you know, like, you know, a high school kid to be successful, 

Ryan: he wants to be the most popular person there. Right? 

Ryan: He gets out of high school. 

Ryan: Success to him might be, man, if I could afford a car. 

Ryan: Right. 

Ryan: Gets a car now he's he's successful and we should always be reaching. 

Ryan: I don't think as a human being 

Ryan: it should be about money. 

Ryan: If that is a fruit of your labor, 

Ryan: that's just a reward. 

Ryan: That's part of it. 

Ryan: So if you take my courses 

Ryan: as an effort to increase your productivity 

Ryan: and that brings you more money, that's a bonus, right? 

Ryan: More importantly, I would say you're successful 

Ryan: because you learned it, you understood it, and that was just an end result. 

Ryan: I wouldn't let the money side define that, but that's just me. 

Ryan: I'm a humble, simple person. 

Ryan: I'm a carpenter. 

Ryan: Me. You don't get much more simple than guys like me. 

Ryan: We launch on piles of wood. 

Ryan: Is very complex. 

Ryan: Now, as I understand. 

Ryan: It, they all hell yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: It, they all hell yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Ryan: I can't walk on water. 

Ryan: That would be interesting. 

Ryan: What what do you hope you leave behind? 

Ryan: I hope that 

Ryan: if I. 

Ryan: If I had a legacy, so to speak, that it was 

Ryan: someone would maybe watch these 

Ryan: or any of the things I've shared with teaching and 

Ryan: take away. 

Ryan: Wow. That guy loved framing. 

Ryan: He loved it. 

Ryan: You could see it. 

Ryan: He enjoyed every part of it. 

Ryan: It was it was part of who he was. And 

Ryan: it's so great that he put all this out here 

Ryan: for us, you know? 

Ryan: And if that can stick around and people can take 

Ryan: an education from me or share in a passion 

Ryan: or at least an appreciation of what it takes to go out in a hot, scalding 

Ryan: sun and the snowstorms and all the things we do 

Ryan: just to perform our job 

Ryan: would be the ultimate honor 

Ryan: to look at a carpenter 

Ryan: and really appreciate the amount of his soul that it takes 

Ryan: to perform his job. 

Ryan: That would be 

Ryan: my ultimate goal. 

Ryan: Above and beyond the education is to share 

Ryan: what it really is to be 

Ryan: a tradesperson. Wow. 

Ryan: In. Yeah, he rendered me speechless. 

Ryan: So, um. 

Ryan: What else? 

Ryan: What else would you like to share? 

Ryan: I don't know. 

Ryan: Don't know if there's anything at this point. 

Ryan: I just made myself speechless. 

Ryan: I'm grateful for all. 

Ryan: I'm grateful for the life that this line of work has provided me. 

Ryan: You know I don't have a, 

Ryan: you know, race cars and speedboats and a mansion on the hill. 

Ryan: But I have 

Ryan: some really great friends that I'll have the rest of my life. 

Ryan: I have some great stories. 

Ryan: I have a particular set of skills that took me half of my life 

Ryan: to learn. 

Ryan: It's all been worth it. 

Ryan: The good and the bad. I'll take it. I wouldn't change any of it. 

Ryan: And I'm grateful for 

Ryan: this opportunity. 

Ryan: You know, I feel like 

Ryan: for me, touching back on success, to me, 

Ryan: this is this is a level of success for me that I, 

Ryan: up until April, never would have imagined 

Ryan: that my voice could get so big 

Ryan: to share in what is so simple and silly to me framing houses. 

Ryan: It's just that's just my day to day life 

Ryan: and to get to teach what I'm doing and, potentially 

Ryan: reach 

Ryan: other people like myself and give them 

Ryan: a piece of my soul. 

Ryan: That's the good stuff. 

Ryan: That's really 

Ryan: that's special. 

Ryan: I'll never, ever, ever be able beat this. 

Ryan: This is it. 

Ryan: So it's been an awesome experience. 

Ryan: I'm so grateful for all of it I'm grateful. 

Ryan: And now that we're through this, I'm 

Ryan: I'm looking forward to a regular workweek 

Ryan: where I don't have Joey and Alfie and all these guys in my face, but 

Ryan: I've really loved every second of it. 

Ryan: You know, I called my father, I talked to him. 

Ryan: Actually, I didn't call him. 

Ryan: I sent him a few pictures and 

Ryan: we exchanged a few texts and he told me, enjoy all of these moments, son.
