00:00:02:12 - 00:00:06:03
Ready to roll them around town.

00:00:06:18 - 00:00:08:19
Speed.

00:00:09:12 - 00:00:12:06
Oh, man. We get to do this again.

00:00:12:09 - 00:00:15:17
All big six, bigger house, big rips.

00:00:16:10 - 00:00:18:07
105, take one.

00:00:18:07 - 00:00:22:12
Substitute, make reference.

00:00:22:23 - 00:00:23:18
All week.

00:00:23:18 - 00:00:25:21
All week long. And five and five.

00:00:27:02 - 00:00:28:21
Yeah. What an experience.

00:00:28:21 - 00:00:29:07
All right.

00:00:29:07 - 00:00:32:19
Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, anything on your mind?

00:00:32:20 - 00:00:35:09
You want to roll up the tongue?

00:00:35:09 - 00:00:37:18
Sure. You guys are awesome.

00:00:38:01 - 00:00:40:09
Did not expect that none of this

00:00:40:20 - 00:00:43:16
obviously was expected, but,

00:00:43:16 - 00:00:44:11
like.

00:00:44:11 - 00:00:47:21
Like I sent you in the text yesterday with that cool picture.

00:00:48:07 - 00:00:50:00
You guys all have a brother in Buffalo.

00:00:50:00 - 00:00:52:17
From here on out, no doubt about it.

00:00:52:17 - 00:00:54:10
Enjoyed every moment.

00:00:54:10 - 00:00:56:20
As weird as it has been.

00:00:56:20 - 00:00:58:10
It's been pretty cool.

00:00:58:10 - 00:01:03:00
Which is weird to not have had any homemade buffalo wings in your backyard.

00:01:03:13 - 00:01:05:11
Yeah.

00:01:05:11 - 00:01:07:03
Yeah, that's kind of a.

00:01:07:03 - 00:01:09:11
Oh, I like
you can get great wings anywhere.

00:01:09:14 - 00:01:12:09
I don't know why they because buffalo is not really famous for anything.

00:01:12:09 - 00:01:14:14
It certainly isn't our football or hockey team.

00:01:14:14 - 00:01:15:11
They're both horrible.

00:01:15:11 - 00:01:20:12
So, uh, they made the chicken wings kind of notorious.

00:01:20:23 - 00:01:22:10
Yeah, I have. Good.

00:01:22:10 - 00:01:23:15
I eat chicken wings everywhere

00:01:23:15 - 00:01:26:16
I go and everywhere I go on like these are better than they are back home.

00:01:27:11 - 00:01:29:11
So I don't I don't know what it is.

00:01:29:13 - 00:01:31:05
I think it was first created.

00:01:31:05 - 00:01:33:05
Here was where that came from.

00:01:33:05 - 00:01:35:12
Okay. Yeah. I haven't seen a single chicken.

00:01:35:17 - 00:01:38:20
Yeah, all of it. Where we are are currently

00:01:38:20 - 00:01:42:00
at North Tonawanda is where the carousel was invented

00:01:43:04 - 00:01:44:08
right here.

00:01:44:13 - 00:01:45:01
Yeah.

00:01:45:20 - 00:01:48:02
Interesting fact. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:48:02 - 00:01:50:17
I feel like I'm driving in circles. All the time.

00:01:50:18 - 00:01:52:18
Right. What? What's your.

00:01:52:18 - 00:01:54:04
When you, uh.

00:01:54:05 - 00:01:56:18
You do like that? Definitely like maps.

00:01:56:18 - 00:02:00:23
So none of us like, tape my feet down.

00:02:02:20 - 00:02:03:01
Yeah.

00:02:03:01 - 00:02:06:06
Speaking of space and time, I'm gonna

00:02:06:06 - 00:02:08:07
you talk about the significance of the space behind you.

00:02:09:05 - 00:02:12:05
Yeah, this shop, we.

00:02:12:05 - 00:02:15:14
We put this together over the course of the last couple of years.

00:02:15:15 - 00:02:20:22
The idea was just what we're doing, move the roof cutting portion of our

00:02:21:12 - 00:02:24:04
our framing details inside,

00:02:24:17 - 00:02:27:09
which was great because it got rid of weather,

00:02:28:05 - 00:02:30:16
you know, and more importantly,

00:02:30:16 - 00:02:34:00
we've noticed now is the space that it saves on site

00:02:34:11 - 00:02:35:16
for the rest of the guys

00:02:35:16 - 00:02:39:05
to have their material kind of scattered about and the forklift.

00:02:39:05 - 00:02:42:02
So I'm not complaining. I don't mind it.

00:02:42:05 - 00:02:43:09
It's nice.

00:02:43:10 - 00:02:45:15
You know, the hot days, it's a little cooler.

00:02:46:02 - 00:02:48:20
The middle of winter, it's a little warmer.

00:02:48:20 - 00:02:51:02
So it's been interesting.

00:02:51:07 - 00:02:52:16
It's very different.

00:02:52:16 - 00:02:54:23
It's not typical for the industry. But,

00:02:56:02 - 00:02:57:09
hey, we'll we'll

00:02:57:09 - 00:03:00:01
we'll try anything that's going to make us faster.

00:03:00:01 - 00:03:01:15
That was the thought.

00:03:02:04 - 00:03:03:19
What does, um.

00:03:03:19 - 00:03:05:19
What does a. Typical day look like for you?

00:03:06:16 - 00:03:09:18
Uh, typical day for me.

00:03:09:19 - 00:03:11:02
There's a lot of cutting.

00:03:11:02 - 00:03:12:01
You know,

00:03:13:02 - 00:03:17:20
if I'm calculating, it'll be depending on the size of the job.

00:03:17:20 - 00:03:21:17
I could spend several days sitting at the little drawing

00:03:21:17 - 00:03:25:03
table, crunching numbers, staring at a plain view drawing.

00:03:25:18 - 00:03:28:09
I like music, so it's always pretty loud in here.

00:03:28:09 - 00:03:30:15
I have the radio going, I'll.

00:03:30:17 - 00:03:33:14
I'll listen to my own playlists, kind of travel around.

00:03:33:15 - 00:03:36:22
Music's very important to me

00:03:37:10 - 00:03:38:16
when I'm cutting.

00:03:38:16 - 00:03:40:08
That's kind of self-explanatory.

00:03:40:08 - 00:03:41:04
But it gets messy.

00:03:41:04 - 00:03:42:23
I. I'll come in here.

00:03:42:23 - 00:03:45:09
I usually start around 7 a.m..

00:03:45:09 - 00:03:48:23
I'll stop around nine 930, have a cup of coffee, a bite to eat.

00:03:49:13 - 00:03:53:13
Lunch is noon and I'll work till 330, 5:00 depending.

00:03:54:19 - 00:03:57:10
And then after the cutting and the calculating,

00:03:57:20 - 00:04:01:10
we trailer the roof right out to the jobsite and I get

00:04:01:10 - 00:04:04:22
to spend a few days with the guys and we put the roof together and

00:04:06:08 - 00:04:10:20
fortunately lately, the last year or so, it's just been right back to the shop.

00:04:10:20 - 00:04:13:02
There's another drawing, here's the roof,

00:04:13:02 - 00:04:16:20
and I'll kind of get my bearings with that.

00:04:16:20 - 00:04:20:07
And then I'll go out to the site and I'll take a guy or two

00:04:20:16 - 00:04:24:12
snap lines on the foundation, get it squared up as we've covered

00:04:24:14 - 00:04:29:11
and transfer the the dimensions over to the plan and start all over again.

00:04:30:06 - 00:04:33:21
Mark up a plan, create a plan view, cut it, build it.

00:04:34:09 - 00:04:36:23
So it's very repetitious for me.

00:04:36:23 - 00:04:41:03
Sometimes I get a little a little break if we get, you know,

00:04:42:01 - 00:04:44:17
if it's not important that I get started on the next one

00:04:44:17 - 00:04:48:09
because I'm so far ahead, I'll fall back and build stairs

00:04:48:09 - 00:04:52:20
or install stairs, you know, pick up work like that on site just to help out.

00:04:52:20 - 00:04:57:07
But like I said, it's been pretty steady, just roofs for quite some time.

00:04:59:02 - 00:04:59:22
We've seen all of the

00:04:59:22 - 00:05:03:00
thought and the math that's involved with what you do throughout the week.

00:05:03:05 - 00:05:06:08
And I'm curious how like

00:05:06:08 - 00:05:09:00
what you know, what are you thinking about?

00:05:09:05 - 00:05:12:22
You want to wake up one day to clear this.

00:05:12:23 - 00:05:16:13
Morning's early morning person here?

00:05:16:13 - 00:05:20:07
Most of my hobbies are early morning things as well.

00:05:20:07 - 00:05:22:15
Fishing, hunting. Done that my whole life.

00:05:22:15 - 00:05:26:18
So I'm up early every day, 5:00, you know, quarter to five.

00:05:27:11 - 00:05:29:08
Have my coffee.

00:05:29:08 - 00:05:31:00
That's the thing with this.

00:05:31:00 - 00:05:34:21
It can be very demanding for me because I get so into it

00:05:34:21 - 00:05:37:21
that it's constantly on my mind.

00:05:38:05 - 00:05:42:08
You know, when I'm driving to work, I'm noticing the rooflines and you know,

00:05:43:01 - 00:05:46:00
a lot of times it's the same roofs I've looked at hundreds of times,

00:05:46:00 - 00:05:51:17
but I'll still find something I missed or appreciate, something I didn't notice.

00:05:52:10 - 00:05:55:04
So mornings I try to stay focused.

00:05:55:04 - 00:05:58:22
All day I turn my phone off, I check it frequently.

00:05:58:23 - 00:06:02:17
Case it's, you know, a job site issue but distractions

00:06:03:16 - 00:06:06:02
will trip me up and then I'll make mistakes.

00:06:06:02 - 00:06:08:01
And my mistakes are huge.

00:06:08:01 - 00:06:10:06
So I try to keep them to a minimum, but.

00:06:11:02 - 00:06:15:01
And then at night I lay in bed and think about roof framing

00:06:16:14 - 00:06:17:20
literally.

00:06:18:14 - 00:06:21:01
So I think I actually with that being said,

00:06:21:01 - 00:06:26:03
a lot of my techniques and approach, I maybe learned subconsciously

00:06:26:03 - 00:06:28:10
because it's always on my mind.

00:06:28:10 - 00:06:33:08
And then when I get to work,
I kind of apply some ideas or thoughts

00:06:33:08 - 00:06:34:10
that I've had.

00:06:34:10 - 00:06:39:03
So it's been a long thing to evolve to what it is now for.

00:06:39:08 - 00:06:40:23
I'm sorry. Just what you're.

00:06:40:23 - 00:06:41:05
You're.

00:06:41:13 - 00:06:46:04
You're sorry, Alfie.

00:06:46:04 - 00:06:48:15
Okay, so where did it start for you?

00:06:50:00 - 00:06:52:01
Framing in general or the roof?

00:06:52:08 - 00:06:52:17
How did.

00:06:52:17 - 00:06:55:10
How did all of this creep into your mind so pervasively?

00:06:56:02 - 00:07:00:01
So we would go back to well,

00:07:00:01 - 00:07:04:09
as as a younger child, I'd say teens.

00:07:04:23 - 00:07:07:20
My neighbor that lived across the street in the town

00:07:07:20 - 00:07:10:20
I grew up in, his father was a contractor.

00:07:11:21 - 00:07:14:22
So my friend and I would always be helping him,

00:07:15:07 - 00:07:18:00
you know, weekends, evenings

00:07:18:20 - 00:07:21:01
through high school and even middle school

00:07:21:01 - 00:07:24:12
on the job, just, you know, cleaning up, doing things like that, stacking lumber.

00:07:24:12 - 00:07:26:18
So I was I was around it.

00:07:26:18 - 00:07:29:04
I've always had

00:07:29:13 - 00:07:32:05
an interest in building things

00:07:32:05 - 00:07:34:18
since I was far as I can remember.

00:07:35:10 - 00:07:39:00
Like Christmas would come every year and I would ask for plastic

00:07:39:00 - 00:07:42:10
airplane models, testers, models, and I would build them.

00:07:42:10 - 00:07:43:23
But, you know, dozens at a time.

00:07:43:23 - 00:07:47:02
I had them hanging all over the ceiling in my bedroom.

00:07:48:05 - 00:07:50:07
Aviation's always been huge.

00:07:50:07 - 00:07:55:12
So that that turned into pillows if you've ever heard that's a company.

00:07:55:12 - 00:07:56:20
But the rubber band powered

00:07:56:20 - 00:07:59:13
where it's all stick framed
and then you put tissue paper

00:07:59:13 - 00:08:03:14
and used soap to stick the tissue and then water decals.

00:08:03:14 - 00:08:07:01
And then that evolved into radio control airplanes.

00:08:07:01 - 00:08:09:13
And I was building and flying those.

00:08:09:13 - 00:08:12:19
So building has always been there.

00:08:12:19 - 00:08:17:02
So I graduated high school, I work that summer.

00:08:17:10 - 00:08:18:08
Oh, also

00:08:19:08 - 00:08:21:21
my father remodeled the house that I grew up in

00:08:21:21 - 00:08:27:06
and he paid the contractor he hired to employ me for a summer.

00:08:27:06 - 00:08:30:01
So it was that was my first taste that,

00:08:30:11 - 00:08:33:17
you know, a decent little paycheck every week.

00:08:34:06 - 00:08:37:10
You know, I had had I had other jobs delivering pizza and things like that.

00:08:37:10 - 00:08:41:06
But working on our own home that I had grown up in,

00:08:42:05 - 00:08:45:17
maybe kind of drove the nail home to get to see

00:08:45:17 - 00:08:49:09
what was behind all the walls that I was so used to for so many years.

00:08:49:09 - 00:08:53:00
And then to bring it all back together and make it new.

00:08:54:07 - 00:08:55:10
I then

00:08:56:01 - 00:08:57:17
I went to college.

00:08:57:17 - 00:09:02:04
I did a year and a half, almost two years again the whole time

00:09:02:14 - 00:09:05:08
during breaks, winter breaks all summer.

00:09:06:00 - 00:09:09:05
I'd take pick up work working on a framing crew

00:09:10:04 - 00:09:12:15
and eventually I went full time,

00:09:13:04 - 00:09:16:23
some sometime around 99, 2000. And

00:09:17:23 - 00:09:20:04
my love for it just kind of took off.

00:09:20:04 - 00:09:24:11
There was everything the smells, the sounds, the crew working together.

00:09:25:02 - 00:09:27:12
There wasn't anything about it that I didn't enjoy.

00:09:27:12 - 00:09:31:02
I mean, the weather, but that just goes with it like anything.

00:09:32:09 - 00:09:35:09
And fast forward, I met my wife

00:09:35:17 - 00:09:39:05
in college there and she graduated.

00:09:39:05 - 00:09:41:16
She's a couple of years older than I.

00:09:41:16 - 00:09:43:22
She moved out here to western New York.

00:09:44:18 - 00:09:48:23
I stuck around back home in Oswego for six months

00:09:50:01 - 00:09:51:21
and I followed her out.

00:09:51:21 - 00:09:54:08
Then I got out here and I looked for a job.

00:09:55:03 - 00:09:58:23
There was hundreds of ads in the newspapers and I called every phone

00:09:58:23 - 00:10:02:18
number and I didn't hear anything for like two weeks.

00:10:03:03 - 00:10:04:22
So I had a little bit of money.

00:10:04:22 - 00:10:06:15
We had an apartment.

00:10:06:15 - 00:10:07:15
I didn't know anybody.

00:10:07:15 - 00:10:10:05
I had no friends, no family, so to speak of.

00:10:10:11 - 00:10:11:14
Sorry. Right.

00:10:11:17 - 00:10:14:06
Getting some kind of sound coming out of this.

00:10:14:06 - 00:10:14:16
I had

00:10:17:00 - 00:10:18:15
our boats commuted

00:10:19:16 - 00:10:22:11
over here in New

00:10:43:14 - 00:10:45:18
to turn up the volume.

00:10:45:18 - 00:10:47:21
Yeah. Oh, do we have.

00:10:47:21 - 00:10:49:06
There's only one way to

00:10:52:09 - 00:10:53:11
run into that.

00:10:53:15 - 00:10:55:22
You know, that's you get real

00:10:55:22 - 00:11:00:21
life on your left in the room today.

00:11:01:07 - 00:11:03:02
Oh you do it on that.

00:11:03:06 - 00:11:03:18
I would do it.

00:11:03:18 - 00:11:06:13
Oh but so when you mute.

00:11:06:13 - 00:11:08:15
Mute, this is just your mic.

00:11:08:15 - 00:11:11:12
So that's if we're hearing him,

00:11:11:12 - 00:11:17:03
you know, I think it was me too, you know?

00:11:17:03 - 00:11:19:22
I don't know. We should be good enough

00:11:20:18 - 00:11:22:05
was enough for

00:11:22:05 - 00:11:25:16
it's been good up until this moment I'm getting so.

00:11:25:16 - 00:11:27:00
Thank you.

00:11:27:06 - 00:11:29:13
You didn't take anything up until then?

00:11:29:13 - 00:11:31:17
Yeah, it just started to feel

00:11:33:06 - 00:11:36:06
sort of up, I guess.

00:11:36:06 - 00:11:38:21
Okay, so you followed your favorite person out?

00:11:39:01 - 00:11:39:23
Yeah. So

00:11:40:23 - 00:11:42:14
I ended up out here

00:11:42:14 - 00:11:47:18
western New York and couldn't find a job as a carpenter for a couple of weeks.

00:11:47:18 - 00:11:49:15
And then all of a sudden, one day,

00:11:49:15 - 00:11:53:00
you know, my cell phone and this is when cell phones were humongous, right?

00:11:53:10 - 00:11:54:22
We're going back.

00:11:55:01 - 00:11:59:00
I got a whole lot of voicemails and not knowing any better.

00:11:59:00 - 00:12:02:07
I, I took the first guy his offer.

00:12:02:07 - 00:12:04:18
They called me back and he worked

00:12:05:09 - 00:12:09:04
in the south towns was it's what we call it here.

00:12:09:04 - 00:12:10:16
But I had no idea what that meant.

00:12:10:16 - 00:12:12:23
So he asked me, you know, where are you coming from?

00:12:12:23 - 00:12:17:03
And I told him and he said, Well, that's like a 40, 45 minute ride every day.

00:12:17:03 - 00:12:20:22
And at that point, I was just so happy to have found some work

00:12:21:11 - 00:12:25:03
that I did that for almost two years. And

00:12:26:11 - 00:12:28:18
I had an older pickup truck

00:12:28:18 - 00:12:32:04
and it started to, you know, have ailments and fuel lines.

00:12:32:04 - 00:12:33:19
I'd fill up my tank on the way to work

00:12:33:19 - 00:12:36:23
and the truck would sit there all day and I'd get in and it would be empty.

00:12:36:23 - 00:12:40:10
I just I couldn't afford to keep doing that. So I

00:12:42:08 - 00:12:46:03
over the course of those couple of years, I had met some other people

00:12:46:03 - 00:12:50:16
and had started, you know, creating racial friendships and relationships.

00:12:50:16 - 00:12:53:21
And one of my brother in law's

00:12:53:21 - 00:12:57:08
best friends worked for a pretty large

00:12:57:08 - 00:13:01:05
commercial construction outfit, and he got me in there.

00:13:01:05 - 00:13:05:12
So I did commercial carpentry for several years, which was great.

00:13:06:07 - 00:13:08:18
I had never been exposed to

00:13:08:18 - 00:13:12:18
drywall and metal stud framing and grid ceilings, and I loved it.

00:13:12:18 - 00:13:15:05
I did that for a few years.

00:13:15:05 - 00:13:19:16
And then him and I, he and I, that same guy became friends

00:13:19:16 - 00:13:24:19
and we started our own business, went back to doing residential stuff.

00:13:24:19 - 00:13:27:00
We did a lot of framing, kind of everything.

00:13:27:00 - 00:13:28:07
I've been lucky with that.

00:13:28:07 - 00:13:31:00
I've, I've done a lot.

00:13:31:01 - 00:13:33:01
It hasn't always been framing,

00:13:33:01 - 00:13:36:11
but framing has been always kind of where my heart was.

00:13:37:05 - 00:13:39:19
I'd get away from it for a little while and I would always come back.

00:13:40:03 - 00:13:41:00
I just I missed.

00:13:41:00 - 00:13:44:02
It was like an old friend.

00:13:44:02 - 00:13:47:21
So I hopped crews here and there, you know, it didn't work out with him

00:13:47:21 - 00:13:49:00
and I, which is fine.

00:13:49:00 - 00:13:50:03
We're still great friends.

00:13:50:03 - 00:13:53:00
I love the guy.

00:13:53:00 - 00:13:56:11
Tried my own hand at running a framing crew, which was amazing.

00:13:56:11 - 00:14:00:14
We were very successful, kind of hit a lull in the work around here.

00:14:00:14 - 00:14:04:05
We had sort of a decline in the industry and a recession

00:14:05:17 - 00:14:06:11
and found a

00:14:06:11 - 00:14:09:17
great company guy I'd been friends with for many years

00:14:09:17 - 00:14:14:08
and we just kind of built up what we've got going on now.

00:14:14:08 - 00:14:19:09
And the the roof cutting was always there and we were always that.

00:14:19:09 - 00:14:24:05
It always gripped me even back before I had moved out here.

00:14:24:05 - 00:14:27:04
I always would look at the older guy out in the front cut

00:14:27:06 - 00:14:30:03
in the rafters, and I just I admired it.

00:14:30:07 - 00:14:32:00
How could he

00:14:32:04 - 00:14:34:06
obtain all of these cuts and measurements?

00:14:34:06 - 00:14:36:13
And then everything just goes together so perfectly?

00:14:36:13 - 00:14:40:20
And it you know, I think no doubt that's every frame and Carpenter's favorite part,

00:14:40:20 - 00:14:45:13
because it's different on on every house walls or walls and floors or floors.

00:14:46:03 - 00:14:51:18
I mean, there's, you know, subtle differences, but the roof is its unique.

00:14:51:18 - 00:14:53:13
So I just I worked on it.

00:14:53:13 - 00:14:57:03
It interests me and I would take that interest home

00:14:57:03 - 00:15:01:05
with me or I'd stay late and we would run string lines

00:15:01:05 - 00:15:06:06
to figure our hip angles and try to calculate our cuts that way.

00:15:06:06 - 00:15:09:14
And I would record all of that in a little book that I kept

00:15:09:21 - 00:15:12:23
in my truck.

00:15:12:23 - 00:15:16:06
I'd build little models, I'd try things, I'd stay after work

00:15:16:06 - 00:15:19:02
when something wasn't quite right and I knew it was off a little bit.

00:15:19:02 - 00:15:24:19
I would stay and try to teach myself, you know, what could I have done differently?

00:15:24:19 - 00:15:26:00
Or What am I missing?

00:15:26:00 - 00:15:27:12
Why is this off?

00:15:27:12 - 00:15:30:14
Why are my, my and my bevels a little off?

00:15:30:14 - 00:15:32:14
You know,
why did I come up a little short?

00:15:33:08 - 00:15:37:09
And that's when I first started
drawing in plan view.

00:15:38:06 - 00:15:40:22
You know, I thought,
why can't I look at this

00:15:40:22 - 00:15:43:22
from above and see what's taking place?

00:15:43:22 - 00:15:46:08
And then the more and more
I practice and I created

00:15:47:03 - 00:15:49:08
dozens of those completely wrong.

00:15:49:13 - 00:15:53:08
It was all about the rise.

00:15:53:08 - 00:15:58:09
I'm not sure where I first
maybe got that idea, but

00:15:59:08 - 00:16:01:04
there isn't a lot of information on it.

00:16:01:04 - 00:16:03:02
You can find it,

00:16:03:06 - 00:16:04:13
but it's

00:16:06:01 - 00:16:08:00
it's not very elaborate

00:16:08:00 - 00:16:10:15
to the extent that we've taken it here.

00:16:11:20 - 00:16:14:06
So I've kind of turned it into

00:16:14:06 - 00:16:16:18
my method. It's

00:16:16:19 - 00:16:18:12
I can do it without that now

00:16:18:12 - 00:16:21:08
using the angles and having the know how.

00:16:21:23 - 00:16:27:07
But that took me many years to realize
I don't really necessarily

00:16:27:07 - 00:16:30:21
need the plan view, but it's always there
and I'm still I still use it.

00:16:30:21 - 00:16:32:16
I shouldn't say I don't because I do.

00:16:32:16 - 00:16:37:08
That's the most important part
of the technique that I'm applying.

00:16:38:08 - 00:16:41:01
But as I've mentioned in our courses,

00:16:41:06 - 00:16:44:02
the more you use those,
the more you start to see

00:16:45:13 - 00:16:48:18
different scenarios and the roof

00:16:48:18 - 00:16:52:14
kind of comes to life right in front of
you on a piece of plywood. So

00:16:53:15 - 00:16:56:00
yeah, it's just been a long,

00:16:56:05 - 00:16:58:12
passionate journey

00:16:58:16 - 00:17:00:09
and I feel lucky for it.

00:17:00:09 - 00:17:02:03
That's the other thing

00:17:03:02 - 00:17:05:12
I may not have ever felt this way.

00:17:06:08 - 00:17:08:19
Had the area that I live in and work in,

00:17:09:10 - 00:17:12:03
didn't have such great architecture
and these great roofs.

00:17:12:03 - 00:17:14:19
So that was kind of out of necessity

00:17:15:05 - 00:17:18:13
and it always intrigued me,
so I just kind of followed it on my own.

00:17:19:10 - 00:17:24:01
So this has been great to get to share
that with fellow carpenters.

00:17:24:07 - 00:17:26:23
So yeah, wild.

00:17:26:23 - 00:17:28:17
1/2, guys.

00:17:29:03 - 00:17:30:04
So, Alan, you have headphones.

00:17:30:04 - 00:17:32:22
Yeah, well, I think

00:17:35:16 - 00:17:37:02
so. Hearing something, it's.

00:17:37:02 - 00:17:39:13
So, so subtle.

00:17:39:13 - 00:17:41:09
Like a like a vibration.

00:17:41:09 - 00:17:43:12
No, no, it's a echo of a speaker.

00:17:44:14 - 00:17:57:06
Despite the things are both know

00:18:00:20 - 00:18:02:04
you going to talk for a second?

00:18:02:04 - 00:18:04:19
Yeah. Alan, are you happy?

00:18:04:19 - 00:18:07:03
Miserable. Oh. Oh, yeah.

00:18:07:03 - 00:18:09:00
Yeah. Is it my mike?

00:18:09:00 - 00:18:10:19
No, no, it's all of the sounds that.

00:18:10:19 - 00:18:12:08
Okay, it's just like,

00:18:13:13 - 00:18:15:15
oh, it should be.

00:18:15:20 - 00:18:18:03
Yeah, I don't hear anything of it.

00:18:18:16 - 00:18:21:09
I actually can't hear
what you guys are hearing

00:18:21:09 - 00:18:22:09
me either.

00:18:22:19 - 00:18:24:17
I just thought it might have been
just coming from the iPod

00:18:24:17 - 00:18:25:16
and we just put a cable in it.

00:18:25:16 - 00:18:28:01
So see, further to the track.

00:18:28:13 - 00:18:31:04
Is it scrubber bill? Was that the term.

00:18:31:17 - 00:18:35:18
Yeah, it is.

00:18:35:18 - 00:18:36:00
All right.

00:18:36:00 - 00:18:44:06
Also, thank you.

00:18:44:06 - 00:18:48:03
Everybody settle and we'll see.

00:18:48:03 - 00:18:50:23
What was it about framing
and like kept you going back?

00:18:50:23 - 00:18:54:01
Going back, going back. Sound like that?

00:18:54:01 - 00:18:57:14
What do you think it was about you
and framing you know what drew would re

00:18:57:16 - 00:19:00:07
what what keeps drawing you to
and what drew you to it?

00:19:01:07 - 00:19:05:13
You know, I've always kind of wondered
and asked myself that same thing,

00:19:05:17 - 00:19:09:05
like whether you believe in destiny
or any of that.

00:19:09:05 - 00:19:14:08
I just something about assembling
things has always just been

00:19:15:22 - 00:19:17:18
even now

00:19:17:18 - 00:19:21:15
I'm a father of three and my oldest son.

00:19:21:22 - 00:19:24:17
We're always like,
we've got a motor apart,

00:19:24:17 - 00:19:26:06
you know, we're working on a dirt bike.

00:19:26:06 - 00:19:27:21
We're doing this or that.

00:19:27:21 - 00:19:32:23
So it's it's always been interesting to me
to watch something

00:19:33:00 - 00:19:35:12
take shape from efforts

00:19:36:06 - 00:19:38:11
from myself or my colleagues.

00:19:40:05 - 00:19:42:02
A lot of that with the framing

00:19:42:02 - 00:19:46:01
and is the way it feels when

00:19:47:15 - 00:19:51:01
you get in your truck in the morning,
you have your cup of coffee,

00:19:51:01 - 00:19:53:13
you got your tool belt in the back,
you're driving to work,

00:19:54:17 - 00:19:55:18
listening to the radio.

00:19:55:18 - 00:19:57:21
You're thinking about the day
you're planning,

00:19:59:19 - 00:20:01:17
kind of how it's going to go.

00:20:01:17 - 00:20:06:22
And then you arrive and you know, the crew
is there and there's piles of lumber

00:20:06:22 - 00:20:10:08
and you watch the sun
come up and then, you know,

00:20:10:08 - 00:20:14:06
you hear the sound of the nail guns
and the saws going in, the fresh lumber

00:20:14:06 - 00:20:19:11
smell, and everyone's busy and the sun
the on your back or in your face.

00:20:19:11 - 00:20:20:18
And it's just a feeling

00:20:21:19 - 00:20:23:08
like you have a real purpose.

00:20:23:08 - 00:20:26:15
Like,
you know, today is going to be a good day.

00:20:26:15 - 00:20:30:13
So for me, it's it's just kind of there.

00:20:30:14 - 00:20:31:10
I don't,

00:20:32:05 - 00:20:35:04
you know, my, my, my father,

00:20:35:04 - 00:20:39:01
I really didn't follow in anyone's
footsteps as far as the trade work goes.

00:20:39:01 - 00:20:41:09
It's just always interested me. And

00:20:42:22 - 00:20:47:09
once I started doing it,
it became more and more apparent that,

00:20:48:06 - 00:20:50:20
Hey, I think I've found what I'm good at.

00:20:51:19 - 00:20:53:10
And for that I'm blessed.

00:20:53:10 - 00:20:58:11
It wasn't it wasn't really ever
about the money for me.

00:20:58:11 - 00:21:00:06
It was about learning.

00:21:00:06 - 00:21:03:19
I've met some of the most incredible
people in my life

00:21:04:00 - 00:21:08:20
working as a as a carpenter,
some of my best days and worst.

00:21:08:20 - 00:21:10:02
I couldn't lie about that.

00:21:10:02 - 00:21:15:07
But some of my best days
have been spent building houses.

00:21:15:07 - 00:21:17:19
I wouldn't trade it for for anything.

00:21:17:19 - 00:21:19:13
So I feel lucky for that.

00:21:19:13 - 00:21:20:13
You know, I think maybe

00:21:22:14 - 00:21:24:21
maybe
people are meant to do certain things.

00:21:24:22 - 00:21:26:01
I don't know.

00:21:26:01 - 00:21:29:23
I like to believe
that I have a lot of other interests,

00:21:29:23 - 00:21:35:04
but I don't feel the way I feel
about framing about anything else

00:21:35:12 - 00:21:38:08
as far as my my passion
and interest for it.

00:21:39:02 - 00:21:42:23
You know, we go we go on vacation
or I'm with my family

00:21:42:23 - 00:21:47:00
and we're all having a conversation
in the truck and here comes a framing job.

00:21:47:00 - 00:21:48:19
We drive by and

00:21:48:19 - 00:21:52:06
I just get pulled out of the conversation
and I'm looking at the guys.

00:21:52:06 - 00:21:56:02
And while that's cool and I'm trying to
guess what the roof pitches are working on

00:21:56:02 - 00:21:57:08
and I'm noticing

00:21:57:08 - 00:22:00:18
all the little things, you know,
and then I'm back in the conversation.

00:22:00:18 - 00:22:02:17
It's just, it's just part of who I am,

00:22:03:16 - 00:22:05:17
which I'll take that.

00:22:05:17 - 00:22:08:16
I'm okay with that.

00:22:08:16 - 00:22:11:14
Once I just just realize that the

00:22:13:02 - 00:22:15:08
people oh, you know,

00:22:15:08 - 00:22:24:15
I have a theory.

00:22:24:15 - 00:22:28:10
I wonder if it's actually
coming from the exact same

00:22:31:03 - 00:22:32:13
things you even know.

00:22:32:13 - 00:22:55:10
So you just got to the more,
I guess, right?

00:22:56:06 - 00:23:09:17
Right. But

00:23:11:16 - 00:23:15:13
also, yeah, um.

00:23:17:16 - 00:23:20:11
I think that's really cool to
they described it earlier too.

00:23:20:13 - 00:23:23:16
Like, you know,
I don't think every kid who like,

00:23:24:07 - 00:23:28:14
you know, remembers like their parents
generation or anything like that of Oh,

00:23:28:14 - 00:23:31:17
look how cool it is to see what's inside
you and all of that, you know?

00:23:31:17 - 00:23:33:09
Yeah. Protected me.

00:23:33:09 - 00:23:35:14
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:35:14 - 00:23:38:05
So it sounds like there's always been

00:23:38:05 - 00:23:44:13
some form of emotional connection to, you
know, the constructed world around you.

00:23:45:06 - 00:23:45:20
Yeah.

00:23:45:23 - 00:23:47:07
So I guess I'm curious, kind of like,

00:23:47:07 - 00:23:49:23
you know, and that's, that's one thing
I think about a lot doing this

00:23:49:23 - 00:23:54:15
type of media is like,
you know, the big picture here is shelter,

00:23:55:12 - 00:23:59:08
which is obviously an essential human need
and our improvements.

00:23:59:14 - 00:24:01:14
Yeah, sure.

00:24:01:14 - 00:24:03:12
Have advanced civilizations. So

00:24:04:19 - 00:24:05:20
the first thing I think

00:24:05:20 - 00:24:08:20
of when I think of shelter is the roof.

00:24:08:20 - 00:24:09:23
Me too.

00:24:09:23 - 00:24:11:21
Over your head. Yeah.

00:24:11:21 - 00:24:13:14
Um, yeah.

00:24:13:14 - 00:24:14:04
So I wonder.

00:24:14:04 - 00:24:17:07
Yeah, like, is there,

00:24:17:07 - 00:24:19:17
you know, what's the you know,

00:24:19:17 - 00:24:21:12
I mean, you're you're a great writer,
as I've seen.

00:24:21:12 - 00:24:30:06
So I'm curious, kind of like, what's your
poetic connection to the roof itself.

00:24:30:06 - 00:24:33:00
The roof aspect

00:24:33:00 - 00:24:34:06
and a house to me?

00:24:34:06 - 00:24:38:17
Well, obviously, that's one of the
all the parts that are important to me.

00:24:38:17 - 00:24:40:17
I would say
the roof is more most important,

00:24:40:17 - 00:24:43:10
but I'm going to be partial to that.

00:24:43:10 - 00:24:46:04
But to me, the roof defines us.

00:24:46:23 - 00:24:51:17
It kind of tells the story of the walls
below because the shape of the roof

00:24:52:21 - 00:24:55:01
follows the shape of the house.

00:24:55:01 - 00:24:58:13
So whether it's, you know,
a big old house with wall

00:24:58:13 - 00:25:01:18
jugs everywhere, it's
going to have lots of hips and valleys.

00:25:01:18 - 00:25:07:12
Or if it's a more subtle, simple house
that's more square or rectangular shaped,

00:25:08:00 - 00:25:12:05
that roof is going to present itself
in a different light as well. So

00:25:13:14 - 00:25:15:18
for me, when I'm up

00:25:16:17 - 00:25:20:03
inside the roof in the attic
and we're putting it together,

00:25:21:15 - 00:25:23:17
you tend to get intimate with it.

00:25:23:17 - 00:25:27:21
When you set a vaguely,
you go right to your your memory

00:25:27:21 - 00:25:31:15
of cutting and figuring
and without even turning around,

00:25:31:15 - 00:25:35:21
you know, there's an inside corner
there on the elevation view.

00:25:35:21 - 00:25:39:20
And then from looking at the prints
for the whole time, you know,

00:25:39:20 - 00:25:43:04
hey, we're over the master bedroom
because I labeled

00:25:43:04 - 00:25:46:09
that the for so

00:25:46:09 - 00:25:49:08
the situational awareness

00:25:49:08 - 00:25:52:03
while I'm on site
actually assembling a roof

00:25:53:10 - 00:25:56:20
is unique to me
because all the guys that I'm

00:25:56:20 - 00:26:00:22
with haven't been through that process
that I've already burned.

00:26:00:22 - 00:26:05:01
I've already assembled the roof
in my mind, multiple times.

00:26:05:01 - 00:26:07:20
So the roof

00:26:09:18 - 00:26:11:21
is unique to each dwelling

00:26:12:04 - 00:26:15:07
and it really does
tell the story in so many ways.

00:26:15:15 - 00:26:17:21
When you look at them from above

00:26:17:21 - 00:26:21:19
and you're looking at the roof lines,
it follows the exact shape of the house.

00:26:21:19 - 00:26:24:10
And then sometimes
they throw little flares,

00:26:25:00 - 00:26:30:09
you know, maybe a turret roof or a bay or
and those are cool little to me.

00:26:30:09 - 00:26:31:07
They're always like

00:26:32:15 - 00:26:33:22
personality.

00:26:33:22 - 00:26:36:17
I think each roof has a personality to it.

00:26:37:01 - 00:26:39:18
And they almost they almost talk to you.

00:26:40:03 - 00:26:44:03
You know, some are aggressive
and they're very steep and they're cut up

00:26:44:03 - 00:26:47:16
and there's hips and valleys
all over where there didn't need to be.

00:26:47:16 - 00:26:50:19
It could have been straight
gables and easier roofline.

00:26:50:19 - 00:26:53:19
So they have a more robust,

00:26:54:10 - 00:26:56:10
sort of aggressive nature to them.

00:26:57:02 - 00:27:00:14
At least that's how I see them
while others.

00:27:00:15 - 00:27:02:00
So sorry.

00:27:02:03 - 00:27:02:10
Yeah.

00:27:02:10 - 00:27:07:15
Now I hear why isn't the cable deployment
the shot that was in.

00:27:07:20 - 00:27:09:20
I can adjust it.

00:27:09:20 - 00:27:13:02
I think that was the fix.

00:27:13:02 - 00:27:17:08
AKC Yeah, so we send the cable back
first again.

00:27:17:16 - 00:27:20:05
Yeah.

00:27:20:05 - 00:27:22:11
Genius Doyle Simple that

00:27:25:13 - 00:27:25:22
give.

00:27:27:21 - 00:27:29:17
A lot of math with the.

00:27:37:23 - 00:27:40:04
I haven't thought about any of this stuff
in so long.

00:27:40:12 - 00:27:42:12
Right. It's great that you're asking.

00:27:42:12 - 00:27:45:22
Oh yeah, that's cool.

00:27:45:22 - 00:27:49:05
Now I feel old
like the last 22 years, just.

00:27:49:06 - 00:27:53:07
I don't know where they want.

00:27:53:07 - 00:27:55:14
Yeah. Let's not lose that train, though.
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

00:27:55:15 - 00:27:58:05
I love that. I just think personality

00:27:59:16 - 00:28:01:22
values like.

00:28:01:22 - 00:28:02:11
Yeah, those.

00:28:02:11 - 00:28:03:10
Those great

00:28:10:09 - 00:28:11:15
Joey's upside down.

00:28:11:15 - 00:28:15:20
Yeah, it's like you put your

00:28:17:05 - 00:28:17:17
foot down.

00:28:17:17 - 00:28:21:19
Yeah.

00:28:21:19 - 00:28:25:01
Physically.

00:28:25:01 - 00:28:27:20
There you go. Well, there you go. There.

00:28:28:03 - 00:28:32:21
No. Yeah, but this doesn't want to rotate.

00:28:33:03 - 00:28:35:01
Yeah, you got to lock it. Well.

00:28:35:01 - 00:28:37:07
You almost had it. Almost.

00:28:37:07 - 00:28:38:01
There you go.

00:28:38:01 - 00:28:38:17
There's

00:28:40:23 - 00:28:41:21
technology.

00:28:41:21 - 00:28:42:17
All right.

00:28:42:23 - 00:28:45:06
The little interior
to a straight up mirror.

00:28:45:07 - 00:28:46:01
Yeah.

00:28:47:12 - 00:28:54:09
Is right.

00:28:54:19 - 00:28:57:10
Yeah.
But this is helping, right. With the.

00:28:57:10 - 00:28:59:10
Oh, yeah, this is great.

00:28:59:10 - 00:29:04:00
Yeah.

00:29:04:00 - 00:29:05:01
For for this.

00:29:05:01 - 00:29:06:07
It's like it's perfect.

00:29:06:07 - 00:29:08:04
I don't know that
it would have been helpful.

00:29:08:04 - 00:29:09:13
Yeah, no, you were right.

00:29:09:13 - 00:29:11:07
Yeah, I think that was fun.

00:29:11:07 - 00:29:13:18
That's
I of feel like. Yeah, human to human.

00:29:14:09 - 00:29:21:20
Yeah.

00:29:21:20 - 00:29:24:01
How's the Mike Allen. Okay, great.

00:29:24:01 - 00:29:27:11
Okay.

00:29:27:11 - 00:29:30:13
Well, good. Worked for 18 earlier and

00:29:32:05 - 00:29:32:12
cool.

00:29:32:12 - 00:29:35:04
All right, so you're riffing
on the personality of the Hudson Valley.

00:29:35:12 - 00:29:35:22
Yeah.

00:29:35:22 - 00:29:38:22
And some some roofs are more.

00:29:38:22 - 00:29:42:20
Much more simple,
straightforward, forward and and subtle,

00:29:42:20 - 00:29:46:02
which give a feeling of.

00:29:46:02 - 00:29:49:11
It's kind of like when you go home
to visit your folks after a while

00:29:49:11 - 00:29:52:06
and you feel like,
you know, you just feel good inside.

00:29:52:20 - 00:29:56:19
Sometimes an easy roof
will give me that feeling

00:29:56:19 - 00:29:59:19
because it's not challenging me

00:30:00:06 - 00:30:02:23
as much as maybe a more as I,

00:30:03:00 - 00:30:06:07
as I think
I put it, aggressive type of roof.

00:30:07:07 - 00:30:11:11
So when I approach, you know, when I first
get the blueprint and I approach,

00:30:11:19 - 00:30:15:20
you know, all of my methodology
that I use, I'm kind of at ease

00:30:15:20 - 00:30:19:19
because I know
it's really not a big challenge.

00:30:20:07 - 00:30:23:07
So we kind of become friends
in the beginning because I know

00:30:23:17 - 00:30:25:14
you're not going to stomp me.

00:30:25:14 - 00:30:28:00
You're not going to, you know, trip me up.

00:30:28:03 - 00:30:30:10
So we're going to have a good week
together.

00:30:30:10 - 00:30:34:01
And then when we go out
and put it together, it's like I like

00:30:34:01 - 00:30:36:21
I love those roofs the best on a Friday,

00:30:37:09 - 00:30:40:10
a nice, straightforward,
easy roof that was

00:30:41:16 - 00:30:44:17
friendly the whole time
through the figuring and the building,

00:30:45:00 - 00:30:48:14
even to the roof sheathing
when those happen on a Friday,

00:30:48:14 - 00:30:54:16
that is a magical weekend for me
because it's just like, oh, yeah, oh,

00:30:54:17 - 00:30:59:10
there wasn't a whole bunch of stress
and anxiety that and that.

00:30:59:10 - 00:31:02:19
That does come with
some of the more challenging

00:31:04:02 - 00:31:04:23
roofs.

00:31:05:11 - 00:31:07:15
And I always welcome that because I do

00:31:07:15 - 00:31:10:09
like a challenge and I like to be
it keeps me sharp.

00:31:11:00 - 00:31:13:16
As I mentioned before you
you get intimate with these.

00:31:13:16 - 00:31:17:18
So some of them will keep me on my toes
and keep me up at night

00:31:19:04 - 00:31:20:23
like a lot of nights

00:31:20:23 - 00:31:24:20
until we for me, the reward there is one.

00:31:24:20 - 00:31:27:19
We're on the on site
and everything has gone together

00:31:28:17 - 00:31:33:15
with very small hiccups and to happen
the truck at the end of the day and see it

00:31:33:15 - 00:31:37:23
together, it's the same feeling of,
you know, a sigh of relief.

00:31:38:16 - 00:31:39:22
And then at that point,

00:31:41:00 - 00:31:43:19
I think I become friends with that roof

00:31:43:19 - 00:31:48:04
that has just been kind of a bully to me
for the last couple of weeks.

00:31:49:01 - 00:31:51:04
Well,
I never I've never been angry with one.

00:31:51:04 - 00:31:53:00
Feels
weird to talk about a roof like that.

00:31:53:00 - 00:31:55:16
But for me, that's
that's really what they are.

00:31:56:00 - 00:32:00:08
Some are challenges the whole time
and some are friendly

00:32:00:08 - 00:32:03:03
and easy and more, you know,

00:32:04:21 - 00:32:06:05
feminine, if you will,

00:32:06:05 - 00:32:08:22
you know, pretty
and you know, all of that.

00:32:09:10 - 00:32:15:00
So I hope there are other carpenters
that can relate to this.

00:32:15:00 - 00:32:19:20
Otherwise
I might be the weirdest dude in the world.

00:32:19:20 - 00:32:21:20
I talk to my project, man.

00:32:21:20 - 00:32:22:16
You have to.

00:32:22:16 - 00:32:23:10
Yeah, you have.

00:32:23:10 - 00:32:26:01
To know,
I actually love this idea of personifying

00:32:27:01 - 00:32:29:22
what your what you're assembling
and what you're building.

00:32:29:22 - 00:32:31:21
So to take that maybe even further,

00:32:31:21 - 00:32:34:16
it seems like whether it's an easy roof
or a hard roof,

00:32:34:16 - 00:32:39:06
whether you guys have struggled or,
you know, talked well together,

00:32:39:06 - 00:32:44:10
the end goal is protection
to protect the family below.

00:32:44:22 - 00:32:48:15
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:32:48:15 - 00:32:51:04
That that is such a reward.

00:32:51:22 - 00:32:55:14
Basically, we're building
we're providing a service, right?

00:32:55:14 - 00:32:59:09
A basic human need, as you've mentioned,
everyone needs shelter.

00:32:59:20 - 00:33:04:02
But more importantly,
to see the excitement on the homeowners

00:33:04:02 - 00:33:05:04
faces when they stop.

00:33:05:04 - 00:33:07:21
We're building people's dreams, right?

00:33:08:00 - 00:33:09:23
We're turning a vision

00:33:11:07 - 00:33:14:11
that they have
into a reality right before their eyes.

00:33:14:11 - 00:33:17:16
And to be a part of that, it's
something that

00:33:19:07 - 00:33:22:01
becomes part of your fabric.

00:33:22:01 - 00:33:24:15
You know,
you spend the more years you do this,

00:33:24:15 - 00:33:29:10
the more of those moments and feelings
you kind of you keep them with you.

00:33:29:17 - 00:33:34:23
It's almost like you have a suitcase
and you just you fire these these feelings

00:33:34:23 - 00:33:39:18
and these memories and they're and it's
great to look back and recall on them.

00:33:40:03 - 00:33:42:12
I take a lot of photos nowadays.

00:33:42:12 - 00:33:43:19
It's with cell phone.

00:33:43:19 - 00:33:45:23
We all have amazing cameras,
right on our phone.

00:33:45:23 - 00:33:48:07
But going back to the beginning,

00:33:48:07 - 00:33:52:14
it was a regular Kodak camera
that I would have, you know, develop.

00:33:52:23 - 00:33:53:14
And then I would

00:33:53:14 - 00:33:57:04
you know, I had purchased my first digital
camera and my wife and I. So

00:33:58:11 - 00:34:01:23
I've always
taken pictures of the entire process.

00:34:01:23 - 00:34:07:02
Now it's more the roof stuff because it's
really gripped my interest for so long.

00:34:07:14 - 00:34:12:04
But yeah, being a part of someone else's
dreams and,

00:34:12:08 - 00:34:15:23
and seeing the joy
that our efforts have brought

00:34:15:23 - 00:34:20:07
and the smiles and getting to meet
all these different people, you know?

00:34:20:08 - 00:34:24:17
But, you know, you build a house for a
young family, a couple with a small child

00:34:24:17 - 00:34:29:07
or or a couple with multiple children
that just needed a bigger house or,

00:34:29:22 - 00:34:32:14
you know, you name it, every walk of life.

00:34:33:14 - 00:34:35:17
And to share in that, for me,

00:34:37:10 - 00:34:39:08
you couldn't put a price on that.

00:34:39:08 - 00:34:40:07
You couldn't.

00:34:40:07 - 00:34:42:03
And I hope that

00:34:43:02 - 00:34:45:22
as a carpenter that we've left our mark

00:34:46:20 - 00:34:49:10
on these people much in the same way

00:34:50:17 - 00:34:52:01
that they have us, even

00:34:52:01 - 00:34:56:06
though our work isn't seen once
leave it all gets covered, right?

00:34:56:06 - 00:34:59:01
Drywall, insulation, paint, trim.

00:34:59:01 - 00:35:03:19
Carpenters come in and make it look
beautiful with trim and fancy words.

00:35:03:19 - 00:35:07:22
And a roofer roofing company
shows up and puts shingles down.

00:35:07:23 - 00:35:13:15
Or so everything that we've kind of poured
our soul into does get covered up, but

00:35:14:11 - 00:35:16:16
it's the bones, it's the skeleton

00:35:17:02 - 00:35:20:17
of the house that these families
will spend the rest of their days.

00:35:20:17 - 00:35:23:09
And to be a part of that,

00:35:23:09 - 00:35:27:03
there's a lot to be said for that means
a lot to me, whether you see it or not.

00:35:27:03 - 00:35:30:11
I can still see it in my mind
and photographs. So

00:35:31:17 - 00:35:35:23
yeah, it's cool how,
how all the trades kind of rely on one

00:35:35:23 - 00:35:39:13
another and come together
and to be one of the first ones in

00:35:40:10 - 00:35:44:16
feels kind of neat, you know, it's
almost like the team captain,

00:35:45:05 - 00:35:48:12
you know, trim,
carpenter, drywall or electricians.

00:35:48:14 - 00:35:51:20
We all work in unison,
but without the framing contractor

00:35:51:20 - 00:35:54:16
and the framing carpenters
is there's no house there.

00:35:55:14 - 00:35:58:16
So it's it's pretty neat
when I think about it like that.

00:36:00:01 - 00:36:03:09
You give the phrase a real meaning, right?

00:36:03:10 - 00:36:06:03
Like these families are meeting the guy,

00:36:06:20 - 00:36:09:12
putting the roof above their head.

00:36:09:12 - 00:36:13:01
Yeah, yeah. And

00:36:13:04 - 00:36:16:22
I talk about that
a lot nowadays and say, you know.

00:36:17:06 - 00:36:18:02
What do you say?

00:36:18:02 - 00:36:21:12
Well, the homeowner, you know,
they'll approach us or even the builder,

00:36:21:12 - 00:36:23:13
even if it's not the homeowner,
if they're not present,

00:36:24:09 - 00:36:26:07
you know, wow, this is great.

00:36:26:07 - 00:36:28:11
It's amazing how much you guys got done.

00:36:28:11 - 00:36:31:03
I'll always turn that into, yeah,
you got a great roof.

00:36:31:03 - 00:36:35:12
You know, see all these hips and valleys
and yeah, usually have no idea

00:36:35:12 - 00:36:38:15
what I'm talking about,
but I love to engage them

00:36:39:00 - 00:36:42:12
and show them like walk around the house
and say, you know, that's an irregular hip

00:36:42:12 - 00:36:43:21
and that's an irregular valley.

00:36:43:21 - 00:36:46:19
And this roof's
incredibly of multiple pitches.

00:36:46:19 - 00:36:49:20
And this area here,
we was difficult for us.

00:36:49:20 - 00:36:53:13
And so I give them kind of a sense of,

00:36:54:01 - 00:36:57:10
oh, wow,
there's a lot that probably goes into this

00:36:57:10 - 00:37:01:20
that we didn't realize, you know, which
I think that's important for all people.

00:37:02:04 - 00:37:04:07
We all need to appreciate one another.

00:37:05:00 - 00:37:10:01
You know, when, when, when you get hurt,
you go and put all of your trust

00:37:10:01 - 00:37:13:03
into a nurse or a doctor
without even thinking about it.

00:37:13:03 - 00:37:15:23
Right.

00:37:15:23 - 00:37:18:10
We all need to be like that in the trades.

00:37:18:10 - 00:37:22:08
I trust that, you know,
the foundation guy is going to do his job

00:37:22:19 - 00:37:26:05
accordingly and then, you know,
they're trusting that we're going to put

00:37:26:05 - 00:37:29:10
a structural house
that's structurally sound on top of that.

00:37:29:10 - 00:37:31:10
And then all the trades that follow suit.

00:37:32:07 - 00:37:34:00
And I think
we all need to help each other.

00:37:34:00 - 00:37:37:06
If there's something you can do to make it
easy for the next guy coming in.

00:37:38:08 - 00:37:38:21
Right?

00:37:38:21 - 00:37:40:20
Why wouldn't we do that?

00:37:40:20 - 00:37:44:07
But yeah,
I really enjoy conversing with homeowners.

00:37:44:07 - 00:37:46:05
The the excitement that they share.

00:37:46:05 - 00:37:49:22
It's the little things you kind of lock
away, put them in your pocket.

00:37:50:23 - 00:37:51:06
Yeah.

00:37:51:06 - 00:37:54:12
It's always usually a good experience.

00:37:54:12 - 00:37:58:03
You're describing something
that, you know, I've been encountering

00:37:59:11 - 00:38:01:11
while making these courses, which is, um,

00:38:02:12 - 00:38:04:11
just how much goes into each trade.

00:38:04:11 - 00:38:07:15
But I do feel like roofing in particular,
especially reframing

00:38:09:18 - 00:38:11:11
like literally no idea.

00:38:11:11 - 00:38:13:20
Like there's so much and

00:38:14:00 - 00:38:17:05
oh yeah, the average person
to understanding

00:38:17:05 - 00:38:23:08
the complexity is like,
why is that so to reframing.

00:38:23:08 - 00:38:26:05
Well, I think the biggest reason it's

00:38:27:01 - 00:38:29:02
even in our own trade, trade specific

00:38:29:05 - 00:38:32:18
to framing
carpentry is the onset of roof trusses.

00:38:33:02 - 00:38:36:15
They've been around for 30 or 40 years,

00:38:36:15 - 00:38:40:12
I would have to guess, not really sure,
but they've been around my entire career,

00:38:41:02 - 00:38:45:09
so I feel like that's
kind of killed our craft in a way.

00:38:45:23 - 00:38:49:04
There's career long framing carpenters
who may feel

00:38:49:09 - 00:38:53:09
the same way I do about what they do,
but they've never had the opportunity

00:38:54:08 - 00:38:55:02
to do it in the

00:38:55:02 - 00:38:58:08
old fashioned way or stick framing,
as we call it,

00:38:58:21 - 00:39:01:22
because it just wasn't the way
it was done in their area.

00:39:03:07 - 00:39:05:01
So I think a lot of light isn't

00:39:05:01 - 00:39:08:14
shed on what we do
because it was more popular

00:39:09:13 - 00:39:12:10
50 years ago.

00:39:12:10 - 00:39:15:12
To me, everything about a stick frame
roof is better

00:39:15:12 - 00:39:18:18
than a manufactured truss.

00:39:18:21 - 00:39:23:01
That's an argument
I've with lumber salesmen

00:39:23:01 - 00:39:25:22
and other carpenters,
you know, social media.

00:39:26:23 - 00:39:28:00
Gosh.

00:39:28:05 - 00:39:30:16
But it has taken

00:39:30:16 - 00:39:34:15
it has removed the craftsman portion

00:39:34:20 - 00:39:40:07
from that step and framing a house
everything up until that point

00:39:40:17 - 00:39:42:00
is the same.

00:39:42:01 - 00:39:46:14
But a truss crew knows
when they get to second floor walls

00:39:47:14 - 00:39:50:18
or if it's a ranch when they're done
with walls, that the trust company

00:39:51:10 - 00:39:52:22
will drop off their trusses

00:39:52:22 - 00:39:56:05
and they'll run a crane
and they'll just set the whole roof

00:39:56:18 - 00:39:59:11
ceiling included
where we're rolling our ceiling

00:39:59:20 - 00:40:02:19
and nailing them to each wall
and making all of the cuts.

00:40:02:19 - 00:40:06:23
So there's there's a lot more involved.

00:40:07:06 - 00:40:11:00
When you stick frame, you're responsible
for the length of every board.

00:40:11:09 - 00:40:12:19
Nothing is being provided.

00:40:12:19 - 00:40:14:15
It's a pile of sticks on day one.

00:40:14:15 - 00:40:16:04
And at the end, you know,

00:40:16:04 - 00:40:20:18
you have a recreation of the blueprint
that you've been using all along.

00:40:20:18 - 00:40:23:08
So I'm grateful for that. If

00:40:24:19 - 00:40:28:03
if trusses come in and take over, I'm out.

00:40:28:07 - 00:40:29:10
I'll move.

00:40:29:10 - 00:40:31:21
I'll have to follow
where the stick framing is.

00:40:31:21 - 00:40:32:19
There's no doubt about it.

00:40:32:19 - 00:40:35:00
It's just part of who I am.

00:40:35:00 - 00:40:38:07
So I think that's the biggest
probably reason

00:40:38:07 - 00:40:40:15
it's not so appreciated anymore.

00:40:42:10 - 00:40:46:08
Which is kind of like, you know, the age
old narrative of technology, right?

00:40:46:14 - 00:40:48:01
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:48:01 - 00:40:48:20
Yeah.

00:40:48:20 - 00:40:50:12
Sometimes

00:40:51:12 - 00:40:53:20
new isn't always better or,

00:40:53:23 - 00:40:56:13
you know, the other
the other side of the fence, as they say.

00:40:56:20 - 00:41:01:13
The idea I admire, I think it's great,
which it's really what we're doing here

00:41:01:13 - 00:41:06:08
in this inside the shop where prefab
and around pre cutting the roof

00:41:06:08 - 00:41:11:01
so we are actually faster stick
framing the roof

00:41:11:01 - 00:41:16:14
than we are having trusses
and we've proven this quite a few times.

00:41:16:14 - 00:41:18:13
We don't use trusses often.

00:41:18:13 - 00:41:20:12
Sometimes there's no way around it.

00:41:20:12 - 00:41:23:00
It was the house was drawn that way.

00:41:23:00 - 00:41:25:03
The architect,
the way the house was engineered,

00:41:25:09 - 00:41:28:23
they just don't want to switch it
to rafters and we need the work.

00:41:28:23 - 00:41:30:16
So we take the job.

00:41:30:16 - 00:41:31:10
Those ones are

00:41:31:10 - 00:41:34:16
always a bummer for me, but you know,
you got to do what you have to do.

00:41:35:09 - 00:41:38:06
We are markedly faster stick framing.

00:41:38:06 - 00:41:43:11
I would put us against any truss screw
if I have everything cut, we're ready.

00:41:43:11 - 00:41:45:14
They have trusses on the ground.
They're ready.

00:41:46:06 - 00:41:47:23
I bet you we're done first.

00:41:47:23 - 00:41:50:19
I would argue that all day long I would.

00:41:50:19 - 00:41:56:06
So the idea of trusses and pre-made,
you know, in getting it to that level,

00:41:57:08 - 00:41:59:15
that's really what we're doing here.

00:41:59:15 - 00:42:01:15
We're just keeping the craftsmanship
in it.

00:42:01:15 - 00:42:03:06
We're not relying on another company.

00:42:03:06 - 00:42:04:18
We're kind of keeping it in-house.

00:42:04:18 - 00:42:07:06
So yeah.

00:42:07:06 - 00:42:10:12
The other cool thing too is like
we've had a chance to see how you apply

00:42:10:12 - 00:42:14:15
your own creative signature,
you know, in subtle ways, but really,

00:42:14:15 - 00:42:17:23
you know, important ways both to you
and to the people that you work with.

00:42:17:23 - 00:42:19:17
And you see your work.

00:42:19:19 - 00:42:22:13
You talk about, you know, how,
how you build your own signature.

00:42:24:09 - 00:42:26:13
Yeah, I think, you know, it all stemmed

00:42:26:13 - 00:42:29:17
from that passion about it all.

00:42:29:17 - 00:42:30:12
You know,

00:42:31:15 - 00:42:35:21
you take something to a certain level
as a person no matter what.

00:42:35:21 - 00:42:37:13
It is right for you.

00:42:37:13 - 00:42:41:15
If you're a musician, you're going to get
to a point where you feel like,

00:42:42:07 - 00:42:43:17
Hey, I'm getting pretty good.

00:42:43:17 - 00:42:46:09
You know, I'm almost mastering this.

00:42:47:23 - 00:42:49:03
Do we complacent?

00:42:49:03 - 00:42:49:22
Do we stop there?

00:42:49:22 - 00:42:51:04
Do we keep reaching?

00:42:51:04 - 00:42:53:04
We always want to be better, right?

00:42:53:04 - 00:42:55:14
If if you feel that strongly
about something,

00:42:56:09 - 00:42:59:19
it's an endless journey of learning
about what

00:42:59:23 - 00:43:02:23
what what it is you're actually doing
as well as learning about yourself.

00:43:03:16 - 00:43:07:15
So I think some of the little things
that I do in regards to my cutting

00:43:07:15 - 00:43:12:13
and roof framing were just that,
you know, hey, I've I've cut

00:43:13:09 - 00:43:15:13
20,000 hip rafters.

00:43:15:13 - 00:43:18:07
How can I cut them differently
to spice things up?

00:43:18:07 - 00:43:18:15
Right.

00:43:18:15 - 00:43:20:15
So I started figuring out and playing
with,

00:43:21:06 - 00:43:23:05
you know, edge the
and backing my shoulders.

00:43:23:05 - 00:43:27:07
So now I do that and I'm asked
that question all the time, you know,

00:43:27:11 - 00:43:29:08
isn't that a waste of time?

00:43:29:08 - 00:43:30:21
You know, time is money.

00:43:30:21 - 00:43:33:06
I could have had that hip cut and nailed.

00:43:33:06 - 00:43:34:02
Yeah, maybe.

00:43:34:02 - 00:43:36:23
If maybe if you're, like,
the fastest person in the world.

00:43:36:23 - 00:43:40:04
But I, I've demonstrated for you
that it literally takes

00:43:40:04 - 00:43:43:05
just a few moments
and the end results better.

00:43:43:05 - 00:43:45:21
And then the argument is, well,
no one will ever see it.

00:43:45:21 - 00:43:49:18
You're going to cover it with plywood
and then shingles and yeah, you're right.

00:43:50:03 - 00:43:50:21
You're absolutely right.

00:43:50:21 - 00:43:54:04
If that's if that's the angle
you want to look at it from, fine.

00:43:54:04 - 00:43:55:11
I feel sorry for you.

00:43:55:11 - 00:43:59:02
I look at it as I spent my time away from

00:43:59:02 - 00:44:02:03
my wife and my children
and everything that I love.

00:44:03:10 - 00:44:05:11
Cutting this roof.

00:44:05:12 - 00:44:09:12
I'm going to make it worth my while,
you know, it makes me happy to do it.

00:44:09:12 - 00:44:12:03
So I do it up ridge boards.

00:44:12:03 - 00:44:14:05
I rip the crown
out of all the ridge boards.

00:44:14:05 - 00:44:15:12
Even if I look at the ridge

00:44:15:12 - 00:44:18:22
and it's perfectly straight now, I just
I have to make that cut.

00:44:19:10 - 00:44:21:21
It's just that one extra little thing

00:44:22:08 - 00:44:26:07
that makes me feel wholesome
about what I'm doing.

00:44:26:07 - 00:44:30:16
So I think that, you know,
those little things just came from,

00:44:31:10 - 00:44:34:11
hey, what can I do a little bit more,
you know, now?

00:44:34:11 - 00:44:39:10
And, and as of lately, I've started
wondering and I've even on a few roofs,

00:44:39:10 - 00:44:42:10
I've beveled the hips or the I'm sorry,
the ridges.

00:44:42:18 - 00:44:46:17
So I'll have the ridge cut the pitch,
cut into the ridge, which is,

00:44:47:08 - 00:44:50:13
you know, I like that
I've been doing that more and more.

00:44:51:00 - 00:44:55:21
And then all the way down to the overhang,
I've contemplated,

00:44:56:15 - 00:44:59:20
Hey, when I have the roof,
maybe I'll have all the fascia material

00:45:00:03 - 00:45:01:07
and I can bevel it all.

00:45:01:07 - 00:45:02:21
So it matches the roof slope, right.

00:45:02:21 - 00:45:05:04
Really take it that far,
which I'll probably try.

00:45:05:17 - 00:45:09:20
I have done it here and there on small
things just to just to kind of see it.

00:45:09:23 - 00:45:12:15
And, you know, if it's,

00:45:14:02 - 00:45:16:07
if it's something that

00:45:16:16 - 00:45:18:20
I don't mind doing

00:45:19:11 - 00:45:23:10
or even if it takes a little longer,
I'll spend the time, the extra time

00:45:23:10 - 00:45:27:09
just to make it so, you know,
it doesn't really affect my productivity.

00:45:27:22 - 00:45:32:00
But every board I cut,
I try to cut perfectly and I can't.

00:45:32:15 - 00:45:36:14
So that's fun to try to always be perfect

00:45:36:22 - 00:45:41:03
and we all know that's impossible,
but it is fun to try.

00:45:41:06 - 00:45:44:12
So those little things,
they just keep me happy.

00:45:45:17 - 00:45:46:11
That's kind of. It.

00:45:46:11 - 00:45:48:07
I mean,
you know, it's an extension of you.

00:45:48:07 - 00:45:49:02
Yeah.

00:45:50:03 - 00:45:52:07
It's a way to express yourself,

00:45:52:07 - 00:45:56:02
you know, a lot of the guys,
when I first started

00:45:56:02 - 00:45:59:02
doing it on on our crew or, you know,

00:46:00:13 - 00:46:03:12
at first, why why did you do that?

00:46:03:12 - 00:46:07:18
You know, speaking about hips and valleys
and I don't know, because I can

00:46:08:05 - 00:46:12:08
because I wanted to look straight,
you know, and through time, over

00:46:12:08 - 00:46:16:14
time of putting all these roofs together,
same group of guys for so long.

00:46:16:19 - 00:46:20:10
They love it now, too, because it
it helps them do their job better

00:46:20:13 - 00:46:23:02
because those pain points are there right
there.

00:46:23:02 - 00:46:26:10
There's no question
they're not citing a Jack

00:46:26:10 - 00:46:30:04
Rafter to the center of a square
shouldered valley rafter.

00:46:30:06 - 00:46:31:12
I've plowed it out for them.

00:46:31:12 - 00:46:35:22
So they just line up
the edge, few nails onto the next one. So

00:46:36:21 - 00:46:39:11
it's kind
of yeah, that's just the way we do it now.

00:46:39:11 - 00:46:41:05
I'll never not do it that way.

00:46:41:05 - 00:46:44:09
Now, at this point, yeah.

00:46:45:12 - 00:46:45:20
Yeah.

00:46:45:20 - 00:46:48:07
I mean, like,
why not put your mark on something that is

00:46:49:10 - 00:46:51:09
an extension of you. Exactly.

00:46:51:09 - 00:46:53:20
Why not. That makes you happy.

00:46:54:01 - 00:46:56:18
That's what I say.
If it makes you happy, do it.

00:46:56:18 - 00:47:00:01
We only get so many trips around the sun,
so do what makes you happy

00:47:00:19 - 00:47:03:06
for sure and enjoy the ride, right?

00:47:05:01 - 00:47:05:09
Yeah.

00:47:05:09 - 00:47:07:06
And the

00:47:08:18 - 00:47:10:04
you were touching on a point earlier

00:47:10:04 - 00:47:14:23
that I want to keep rolling on the

00:47:19:02 - 00:47:22:06
custom stick framing with. Um,

00:47:24:04 - 00:47:26:07
you know, it's, it's, it's, it's
the reason we're here.

00:47:26:09 - 00:47:29:04
It's like process.

00:47:30:20 - 00:47:34:20
And, you know, we've talked throughout
the week about how kind of

00:47:35:22 - 00:47:37:07
limited

00:47:38:06 - 00:47:41:01
conversation and access
to that knowledge is.

00:47:41:01 - 00:47:43:19
But you've taken an initiative to share

00:47:44:06 - 00:47:47:10
what you know, like,
you know, from, from within. You.

00:47:47:10 - 00:47:49:12
You've just self started

00:47:49:22 - 00:47:52:18
educating the masses out of

00:47:52:19 - 00:47:55:12
I think a passion for what you do,
but also have a passion to,

00:47:55:14 - 00:47:56:17
to share the knowledge,

00:47:56:17 - 00:47:59:16
you know, I mean, you know, I'm talking
definitely about your Instagram account.

00:48:00:01 - 00:48:00:13
Yeah.

00:48:00:14 - 00:48:04:01
And you know, the last five days
have, um, have shown that, um,

00:48:05:00 - 00:48:08:05
you know,
you have a natural penchant for teaching.

00:48:08:05 - 00:48:09:13
So that means a.

00:48:09:13 - 00:48:12:15
Lot like what, you know, what education

00:48:12:23 - 00:48:17:23
and sharing the knowledge of this trade.

00:48:17:23 - 00:48:22:01
You got started doing that.

00:48:22:01 - 00:48:26:17
So it was, you know,
it was pretty clear to me the older I got,

00:48:27:12 - 00:48:30:01
you know,
and I got more savvy with electronics

00:48:30:01 - 00:48:34:12
and our cell phones
and there's social media and YouTube

00:48:34:12 - 00:48:38:06
and Instagram and Facebook
and there's there's ways to connect

00:48:38:06 - 00:48:42:20
now that we didn't have
when I started in this industry. So

00:48:44:09 - 00:48:48:02
I started realizing fairly quickly that,

00:48:49:13 - 00:48:53:02
wow, you are doing something
a little different

00:48:53:02 - 00:48:57:17
than what everyone else is doing,
or at least what I had found,

00:48:58:10 - 00:49:02:09
which then turned into, you know, I'd have

00:49:03:21 - 00:49:05:09
private messages

00:49:05:09 - 00:49:09:15
sent to me or emails question, you know,
with questions regarding roof framing.

00:49:09:15 - 00:49:11:20
And I thought, could it be

00:49:12:04 - 00:49:16:12
could someone really care what I thought
or how I do this?

00:49:17:00 - 00:49:21:09
And that became more apparent the more
I started putting myself out there.

00:49:21:09 - 00:49:24:07
So I've tried to teach

00:49:25:13 - 00:49:26:15
as much as I can.

00:49:26:15 - 00:49:30:00
It's it's hard to find the time
which I've been working on,

00:49:30:00 - 00:49:35:18
and I've been recording my own videos
for some time now, very poorly

00:49:35:18 - 00:49:39:12
in comparison to what I've learned
this week here with this has just been

00:49:40:22 - 00:49:45:04
my dream come true.

00:49:45:04 - 00:49:48:07
Explaining what you do

00:49:48:07 - 00:49:51:09
isn't always the easiest thing.

00:49:51:09 - 00:49:53:23
It's kind of like stream of consciousness.

00:49:53:23 - 00:49:54:10
That's right.

00:49:54:10 - 00:49:57:18
So when you're really in the moment
and you're doing what you do,

00:49:58:08 - 00:50:03:23
I can explain it much easier than if I'm
at a picnic table or having a picnic.

00:50:03:23 - 00:50:08:11
And some guy asks me, Hey, how do you,
you know, lay out a hip rafter?

00:50:09:08 - 00:50:10:12
I could still get through it.

00:50:10:12 - 00:50:16:06
But most of the stuff that I've tried to
teach has been basic stuff.

00:50:16:06 - 00:50:18:16
I've shared some more complicated things

00:50:19:21 - 00:50:23:00
as of lately.

00:50:23:00 - 00:50:24:09
I hope

00:50:25:08 - 00:50:27:06
that I'm received well.

00:50:27:06 - 00:50:31:07
It's, you know, it's it's
it's had its ups and downs.

00:50:31:07 - 00:50:33:03
I do enjoy teaching.

00:50:33:03 - 00:50:34:23
I don't get enough feedback.

00:50:34:23 - 00:50:36:12
I get a lot of positive feedback.

00:50:36:12 - 00:50:38:00
I get a lot of negative feedback.

00:50:38:00 - 00:50:39:13
You know, you could cure cancer.

00:50:39:13 - 00:50:41:12
They're going to find a reason
to hate you.

00:50:41:12 - 00:50:43:19
So that's been kind of what it is.

00:50:43:19 - 00:50:46:21
Whatever there's there's a lot of other
amazing

00:50:46:21 - 00:50:49:14
people that I see every day

00:50:49:22 - 00:50:53:17
and Instagram, Facebook,
that it's just very humbling

00:50:53:17 - 00:50:57:08
to see how talented and passionate
other people are.

00:50:57:08 - 00:51:02:07
So if I could have a small
piece of helping other people

00:51:03:14 - 00:51:04:23
progress with

00:51:04:23 - 00:51:08:20
reframing or framing in general,

00:51:09:22 - 00:51:13:02
that would be the biggest honor to me.

00:51:13:02 - 00:51:15:05
I would feel like

00:51:15:12 - 00:51:17:11
I kind of left my mark, you know,

00:51:17:11 - 00:51:20:22
as they say, you can't keep your trade
until you give it away.

00:51:21:06 - 00:51:23:23
So I'm all about the education.

00:51:23:23 - 00:51:26:02
There wasn't
there wasn't a lot there for me

00:51:26:02 - 00:51:30:00
growing up to learn from
unless I found, you know, a book published

00:51:30:04 - 00:51:34:05
30 years prior and at that point,
the game had changed so much.

00:51:34:19 - 00:51:38:11
We haven't really kept the trades
up to speed, at least mine.

00:51:38:15 - 00:51:40:20
I mean, we, we drive nails with hammers.

00:51:40:20 - 00:51:43:11
So it's not really
and you need to wear a helmet.

00:51:43:11 - 00:51:46:02
So it's not like
you have to be a rocket scientist.

00:51:46:02 - 00:51:50:18
But what we do, it's been
it hasn't changed, as you said, shelter.

00:51:50:21 - 00:51:55:09
So while you know, the tools have improved
and our materials,

00:51:56:03 - 00:51:58:07
the techniques are starting
to come around.

00:51:58:15 - 00:51:59:13
And I feel

00:52:00:19 - 00:52:02:22
most of the trade education

00:52:02:22 - 00:52:06:00
in regards to framing is material

00:52:07:06 - 00:52:09:01
kind of related.

00:52:09:10 - 00:52:11:09
Hey, we have new sheathing out.

00:52:11:09 - 00:52:12:22
This is how we do it.

00:52:12:22 - 00:52:16:00
The techniques in which we use

00:52:16:00 - 00:52:19:10
to get a structure
built have really not changed.

00:52:19:10 - 00:52:21:10
We have some we have nail guns now.

00:52:21:10 - 00:52:25:04
We, you know, we use air, we have battery
powered guns, cordless saws.

00:52:25:12 - 00:52:27:15
All of that has come a long way.

00:52:27:15 - 00:52:31:23
And I feel like the education was focused
towards that, more

00:52:31:23 - 00:52:34:13
so than how do we

00:52:35:15 - 00:52:37:17
actually do,

00:52:37:18 - 00:52:38:07
right?

00:52:38:07 - 00:52:41:06
So I learned on the job site, right,

00:52:41:21 - 00:52:45:10
late nineties, early, thousands
making mistakes, getting yelled at.

00:52:45:10 - 00:52:49:19
You know,
I always was afraid to let my my boss down

00:52:50:00 - 00:52:53:11
if he showed me that
I did something poorly.

00:52:53:15 - 00:52:54:22
When he made that apparent,

00:52:55:21 - 00:52:57:05
it bothered me.

00:52:57:05 - 00:52:59:20
You know, I was like,
it's like when you're a young boy and your

00:52:59:20 - 00:53:02:20
your father comes down on you
and he yells that you feel bad.

00:53:04:07 - 00:53:06:14
That's how it was for me.

00:53:06:17 - 00:53:09:09
I always wanted to make my employer happy

00:53:09:09 - 00:53:14:13
and I wanted to be prideful in my work,
and I figured that out pretty quickly.

00:53:14:13 - 00:53:19:09
So I kind of fell into place
and moved my way up

00:53:19:21 - 00:53:22:20
through the ranks,
just through old fashioned hard work.

00:53:23:13 - 00:53:26:09
So you don't have to.

00:53:26:13 - 00:53:28:15
Not everyone has to go to college.

00:53:28:15 - 00:53:29:18
We need mechanics.

00:53:29:18 - 00:53:33:06
We need carpenters and plumbers
and AC guys

00:53:33:06 - 00:53:36:13
and electricians
and concrete guys and arborists.

00:53:36:13 - 00:53:40:04
I mean, it's okay to work with your hands.

00:53:40:04 - 00:53:42:18
In fact, I find it extremely rewarding.

00:53:43:16 - 00:53:47:13
With that being said, a lot of jobs,
you do have to go to college

00:53:47:13 - 00:53:48:17
because there's a lot there.

00:53:48:17 - 00:53:50:18
There's a lot to
know. What we what we do is

00:53:51:22 - 00:53:54:17
much, much easier on many levels.

00:53:55:18 - 00:53:57:16
But it takes years to learn.

00:53:57:16 - 00:54:00:15
It does and to teach and share in that

00:54:01:17 - 00:54:04:22
hopefully will give the younger
generations

00:54:05:03 - 00:54:08:02
coming up, you know, a jumpstart.

00:54:08:02 - 00:54:08:18
Right.

00:54:09:08 - 00:54:12:22
I mean, my my oldest son,
he just turned 14.

00:54:12:22 - 00:54:14:20
He loves coming to work with dad.

00:54:14:20 - 00:54:16:15
You know, he likes to have a little money
in his pocket.

00:54:16:15 - 00:54:17:10
He's interested.

00:54:17:10 - 00:54:21:00
He's that similar type of mind
that I have,

00:54:21:11 - 00:54:23:17
and I'm
not going to push him to go to college.

00:54:24:04 - 00:54:26:16
I tell him, you do what you want to do.

00:54:27:05 - 00:54:30:01
If you want to, you want to go that route,
that's fine if you want to.

00:54:30:18 - 00:54:34:13
You know, I'm not going to say
I want a different life for you.

00:54:35:04 - 00:54:38:14
Obviously, I want the best of everything
for my children.

00:54:38:14 - 00:54:40:17
But I also know how rewarding

00:54:40:17 - 00:54:44:05
it's been for me,
despite the challenges and the hard times.

00:54:44:10 - 00:54:47:13
That's okay because life always easy.

00:54:48:07 - 00:54:51:00
And to simply make decisions based on

00:54:52:08 - 00:54:55:05
how easy it will make your life

00:54:55:05 - 00:54:57:07
to me is a total wrong approach.

00:54:57:07 - 00:55:00:06
I say, as I mentioned before,
do what you like to do.

00:55:00:21 - 00:55:03:17
Hey, if you enjoy this, you know,
whatever that may be,

00:55:04:13 - 00:55:08:01
but you can go over here and do this
and make a little bit more money.

00:55:09:00 - 00:55:10:20
That, to me, that's

00:55:11:07 - 00:55:12:06
that's a no brainer.

00:55:12:06 - 00:55:17:02
Do what you love,
you know, to be a happier person.

00:55:17:02 - 00:55:21:04
And that's my approach with what these
younger guys we have some on our cruise

00:55:21:04 - 00:55:23:20
now. I try to infect them

00:55:24:05 - 00:55:28:11
with the passion and feeling
it gives me to be there.

00:55:28:11 - 00:55:31:23
You know, they've been on the job site
for two weeks without me.

00:55:32:20 - 00:55:34:18
Here comes the rafters.
They show up, right?

00:55:34:18 - 00:55:36:03
Oh, Ryan's here. My tool belt.

00:55:36:03 - 00:55:38:17
And here we go,
you know. Hey, how you doing?

00:55:38:17 - 00:55:40:11
Hi. I'm saying hello to everybody.

00:55:40:11 - 00:55:45:05
I try to grab those, you know, younger
the older teens and the younger twenties

00:55:45:05 - 00:55:50:08
and sit with them on launch and,
you know, try to make them think that roof

00:55:50:13 - 00:55:53:13
framing is the absolute
most amazing thing in the world,

00:55:53:13 - 00:55:56:08
because I want to, in fact, them
with that.

00:55:56:15 - 00:55:57:19
I want them to stay.

00:55:57:19 - 00:56:02:00
Hey, we need to help be there,
a certain type of person to still be here.

00:56:02:14 - 00:56:06:11
So I want them to
look at a man my age and say,

00:56:07:12 - 00:56:09:08
wow, he really still likes this.

00:56:09:08 - 00:56:14:21
He loves it like either this guy is cuckoo
or maybe I've made the right decision.

00:56:14:21 - 00:56:15:20
Maybe I'll see it through.

00:56:15:20 - 00:56:17:01
Maybe I'll stick with this.

00:56:17:01 - 00:56:18:20
You know, he seems to enjoy it.

00:56:18:20 - 00:56:20:03
He seems happy.

00:56:20:03 - 00:56:22:15
So I think that's all with the teaching
and the

00:56:23:05 - 00:56:25:18
in the sharing,
you know, like we're doing here,

00:56:27:05 - 00:56:29:04
I think that is the future.

00:56:29:04 - 00:56:30:01
I really do.

00:56:30:01 - 00:56:32:06
And the trades need it more than ever.

00:56:33:00 - 00:56:35:21
They really do.

00:56:35:21 - 00:56:38:18
I think a key point that
you kind of alluded to as well is that

00:56:39:20 - 00:56:42:05
an individual's intelligence is not

00:56:42:05 - 00:56:44:23
measured by acknowledges degrees.

00:56:45:07 - 00:56:45:21
Yeah.

00:56:45:21 - 00:56:48:15
Like I don't know, I'm racking my brain
all week to see if I,

00:56:48:20 - 00:56:51:17
you know, anybody who could

00:56:51:17 - 00:56:54:15
calculate
and care to the degree that you do.

00:56:55:13 - 00:56:56:01
Yeah.

00:56:56:01 - 00:56:59:09
So mean you guys have made that evident
to me as well.

00:57:00:07 - 00:57:02:23
That's back to the appreciation
of what others do.

00:57:02:23 - 00:57:06:11
I mean, people are amazing, but

00:57:07:23 - 00:57:11:01
when I graduated high school in 1999,

00:57:11:06 - 00:57:14:01
you know, they had career day
and all these career fairs,

00:57:14:08 - 00:57:17:12
there wasn't a bricklayer there
or an electrician

00:57:17:12 - 00:57:21:13
or a framing carpenter, probably
because they just couldn't leave the job.

00:57:21:13 - 00:57:22:01
Right.

00:57:22:01 - 00:57:24:19
There's always a lot of work.
There's so much work to do all the time.

00:57:24:19 - 00:57:27:11
But it almost felt like

00:57:28:15 - 00:57:31:08
if I didn't go to college,

00:57:31:08 - 00:57:35:23
I would be not received the same
or maybe even looked down upon.

00:57:36:10 - 00:57:38:11
And that's a tough stigma.

00:57:38:11 - 00:57:39:13
You know,

00:57:40:08 - 00:57:42:02
I don't appreciate

00:57:42:02 - 00:57:45:04
the phrase I work in construction.

00:57:45:10 - 00:57:47:03
I think that's too generalized.

00:57:47:03 - 00:57:49:17
When I hear that, I'll say,
Oh, what do you do?

00:57:49:17 - 00:57:51:03
Well, you know, I'm a mason.

00:57:51:03 - 00:57:53:05
I said, Well,
you don't work in construction.

00:57:53:05 - 00:57:54:19
You're an artist, right?

00:57:54:19 - 00:57:58:23
That's some of my I told you earlier
this week some some of my favorite lunch

00:57:58:23 - 00:58:02:19
breaks are where there's a crew of Masons
in the line of sight for me.

00:58:02:19 - 00:58:07:10
And can eat my lunch and watch them
lay bricks or stack stones.

00:58:07:10 - 00:58:09:11
It's just fascinating to me.

00:58:09:20 - 00:58:13:07
And then I'll go over,
maybe even introduce myself, say hello.

00:58:13:07 - 00:58:15:07
Sometimes I'll eat lunch with them

00:58:15:07 - 00:58:17:23
or I'll wait till they leave
and I'll go over and look at their work.

00:58:17:23 - 00:58:23:07
And it's you know, I have a deep appreciation for the trades because work in them.

00:58:24:10 - 00:58:27:19
You guys have given me

00:58:27:21 - 00:58:29:12
so much.

00:58:29:12 - 00:58:31:19
It's been it's been humbling to see what

00:58:31:19 - 00:58:35:01
took place here this week
and the thought processes.

00:58:35:12 - 00:58:40:01
And as you said,
you can tell that I care about what I do

00:58:40:01 - 00:58:43:11
and I feel the same exact way about you
guys.

00:58:43:11 - 00:58:45:22
It's been you all seem to enjoy it.

00:58:46:11 - 00:58:48:16
Happy every day you're creating

00:58:50:15 - 00:58:53:04
educational videos that are going to make

00:58:55:14 - 00:58:56:23
an absolute necessity.

00:58:56:23 - 00:58:59:21
As we stated, human shelter. Right?

00:58:59:21 - 00:59:02:08
It's going to bring it more to light

00:59:02:08 - 00:59:05:21
and hopefully bring more people in
because we need that

00:59:07:06 - 00:59:11:04
and hopefully that continues to happen.

00:59:11:04 - 00:59:11:21
What does it.

00:59:11:21 - 00:59:16:09
Take to be a good student?

00:59:16:09 - 00:59:18:19
To be a good student

00:59:18:20 - 00:59:21:17
for me is all about attitude.

00:59:22:20 - 00:59:28:21
It's not, you know, I don't need you
to show me how smart you are.

00:59:28:21 - 00:59:31:11
I need you to show me that you're eager
to learn.

00:59:32:05 - 00:59:33:02
You're listening.

00:59:33:02 - 00:59:36:12
You have to be a good listener
and you have to be really good

00:59:36:12 - 00:59:37:13
at making mistakes.

00:59:37:13 - 00:59:40:02
Meaning, if you don't make any mistakes,

00:59:40:13 - 00:59:44:15
I'm going to start wondering
why we're even in front of each other.

00:59:44:15 - 00:59:45:09
Right? So

00:59:46:13 - 00:59:49:02
to ask questions

00:59:49:02 - 00:59:52:03
and then I like to see the lights go off.

00:59:52:03 - 00:59:54:03
And it's happened several times for me,

00:59:56:07 - 00:59:58:21
being a good student,

00:59:58:23 - 01:00:02:15
I think you just need to have
the right amount of interest, right?

01:00:02:15 - 01:00:05:09
It's hard for me to learn about something
that's not interesting.

01:00:06:00 - 01:00:09:13
If I'm interested in something
and I read about it

01:00:09:13 - 01:00:11:14
or I listen to someone talk about it,

01:00:12:22 - 01:00:17:10
I'll take a certain level of knowledge
away.

01:00:17:18 - 01:00:21:22
If I'm sitting in something
that's boring to me, you know,

01:00:23:05 - 01:00:24:11
I won't remember as much.

01:00:24:11 - 01:00:28:18
So I think, I think to be a really good
student, you have to be interested

01:00:28:18 - 01:00:34:02
A, B, you have to have a good attitude,
meaning you have to be positive.

01:00:34:02 - 01:00:38:09
You have to be able to receive
criticism, constructive criticism.

01:00:40:09 - 01:00:42:10
You kind
of have to leave your feelings out of it.

01:00:42:10 - 01:00:48:07
Or maybe old habits is, if I'm responsible
for teaching you, I want you.

01:00:49:03 - 01:00:52:01
I'm inviting you
to try and think along with me.

01:00:52:11 - 01:00:58:04
Now there's 100 other ways to do exactly
what I do, but I want to show you my way.

01:00:58:05 - 01:01:00:01
I want you to absorb that.

01:01:00:01 - 01:01:03:13
And then I'm willing
to have the conversation of, Hey,

01:01:03:13 - 01:01:05:14
well,
we can try it like this or like that.

01:01:05:18 - 01:01:08:01
And through
that could come personal growth

01:01:08:01 - 01:01:10:08
for both the teacher and the student,

01:01:10:08 - 01:01:14:02
because it's not certainly my way
or the highway, right?

01:01:14:02 - 01:01:17:08
There's always things to learn,
which I mentioned earlier.

01:01:17:08 - 01:01:19:14
I'm still learning every day.

01:01:19:14 - 01:01:21:05
So that's a big point to me.

01:01:21:05 - 01:01:22:19
Be available.

01:01:22:19 - 01:01:27:22
Listen, have a good attitude
and you have to have interest and

01:01:29:16 - 01:01:31:18
you have to spend the time.

01:01:31:18 - 01:01:33:13
That's the biggest thing.

01:01:33:13 - 01:01:38:22
When all is said and done
and say your lesson is done for the day

01:01:38:22 - 01:01:42:11
or what have you, and you're back
home is to keep it going.

01:01:43:02 - 01:01:46:15
Keep thinking about it,
keep studying it, keep practicing it.

01:01:46:15 - 01:01:51:04
That's that's what I did for many years
in my garage, you know, at night.

01:01:51:04 - 01:01:55:15
So there's got to be a hunger
there to be a good student, in my mind.

01:01:55:15 - 01:01:58:05
At least that's for me.

01:01:58:08 - 01:01:58:22
Yeah.

01:01:59:11 - 01:02:01:21
I mean, it's, it's, you know,
I mean, at least you embody it.

01:02:01:21 - 01:02:02:23
Yeah.

01:02:03:00 - 01:02:06:00
Yeah, I appreciate that.

01:02:06:00 - 01:02:07:05
And I check my notes real quick here.

01:02:07:05 - 01:02:07:13
Right.

01:02:07:13 - 01:02:10:22
But, but also I have done it.

01:02:11:03 - 01:02:12:09
That's on your mind.

01:02:16:00 - 01:02:17:00
Kind of upside

01:02:17:00 - 01:02:23:20
down.

01:02:23:20 - 01:02:26:01
That's my boss falling asleep.

01:02:26:01 - 01:02:44:14
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:44:14 - 01:02:45:15
I got a couple more

01:02:49:11 - 01:02:49:19
cameras.

01:02:49:19 - 01:02:50:03
All good.

01:02:50:03 - 01:02:53:03
Rolling, rolling.

01:02:53:03 - 01:02:54:22
Joey's upside down.

01:02:54:22 - 01:02:57:01
Now. That's all right.
I can talk to you upside down.

01:02:57:01 - 01:02:59:17
You know what I mean?

01:02:59:17 - 01:03:01:22
Like you said, you get it. But, yeah.

01:03:01:22 - 01:03:04:07
You know what
I look like from every angle, probably.

01:03:04:07 - 01:03:08:19
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:03:08:19 - 01:03:12:04
Look good, bro. Like T-shirts, man.

01:03:12:04 - 01:03:14:21
They're thinning.

01:03:14:21 - 01:03:17:22
Oh, man. Um,

01:03:19:00 - 01:03:19:10
cool.

01:03:19:10 - 01:03:28:13
Everybody get set. Go.

01:03:28:13 - 01:03:31:11
What?

01:03:31:11 - 01:03:35:03
What's your biggest hope in?

01:03:35:03 - 01:03:38:05
What do you hope that today's carpenters
take away from what?

01:03:38:05 - 01:03:43:11
We've just been learning about it
with that group?

01:03:43:11 - 01:03:46:06
I think the biggest thing,

01:03:46:12 - 01:03:48:15
my biggest hope for what

01:03:49:23 - 01:03:51:17
a future student may take away from

01:03:51:17 - 01:03:55:11
this is not even necessarily learning

01:03:56:03 - 01:03:58:19
and being better at what they do,

01:03:58:20 - 01:04:02:17
as much as being passionate
about what they do.

01:04:03:19 - 01:04:05:20
A particularly

01:04:05:20 - 01:04:10:04
shitty car.

01:04:10:04 - 01:04:11:21
Okay, but we're right.

01:04:11:21 - 01:04:13:23
Thank you.

01:04:13:23 - 01:04:17:21
My biggest hope
for the students that may take this is

01:04:19:14 - 01:04:21:22
for obvious reasons, the education
and getting better.

01:04:21:22 - 01:04:24:04
But more importantly would be to

01:04:25:10 - 01:04:28:11
maybe be more passionate, maybe

01:04:29:12 - 01:04:34:23
feel what I've shared for themselves,
because I think it takes a level

01:04:34:23 - 01:04:39:04
of passion and intensity
to get better at things.

01:04:39:04 - 01:04:39:17
Right?

01:04:39:19 - 01:04:43:05
I mean, practice makes perfect,
as they say.

01:04:43:05 - 01:04:48:04
To have a level of passion about something
makes the practice easier, right?

01:04:48:04 - 01:04:50:20
You're not so afraid
when when you make mistakes

01:04:51:05 - 01:04:54:06
or when it takes you longer to understand
something,

01:04:54:13 - 01:04:57:17
you're still hungry for it
because you're because of the passion.

01:04:57:17 - 01:05:00:04
So it kind of keeps you motivated.

01:05:00:16 - 01:05:03:06
It's sort of the
the gas in the tank for me.

01:05:04:02 - 01:05:07:02
You know, when I have
I have difficult days sometimes

01:05:07:02 - 01:05:11:11
for whatever reason was a long week
with with my children or my family and

01:05:12:02 - 01:05:14:20
I got a lot of things
going on outside of work.

01:05:14:20 - 01:05:17:22
And when I come to do what I do, it's

01:05:17:22 - 01:05:21:23
a lot easier for me to push all that away
and focus on

01:05:21:23 - 01:05:25:06
what I'm doing
because I genuinely enjoy it.

01:05:26:03 - 01:05:30:06
So more importantly,
I hope that I've conveyed that

01:05:31:05 - 01:05:32:16
through our lessons.

01:05:32:16 - 01:05:35:10
I do want them to understand and learn.

01:05:36:03 - 01:05:40:04
It would be really cool
to see a whole bunch of companies

01:05:40:04 - 01:05:44:13
out there pretty cutting roofs
that would be like the ultimate honor.

01:05:44:13 - 01:05:46:12
It would be mind bending.

01:05:46:12 - 01:05:48:15
And I'm confident that,

01:05:48:22 - 01:05:52:15
you know, with the techniques
that I've shown, that that's

01:05:52:15 - 01:05:56:05
probably not so far out of reach
for a lot of guys that are very close.

01:05:56:12 - 01:05:58:14
And for those that are kind of new
to this,

01:05:59:19 - 01:06:03:01
well, you're going to have a leg up on me
because this took many years

01:06:03:01 - 01:06:03:19
to figure out.

01:06:03:19 - 01:06:06:21
So for me to share that is, again,
an honor.

01:06:08:04 - 01:06:10:21
Yeah.

01:06:10:21 - 01:06:13:00
Another thing I feel like I've learned
this week is like,

01:06:13:01 - 01:06:15:10
I mean, you build the roof up here.

01:06:15:10 - 01:06:15:18
Yeah.

01:06:15:18 - 01:06:18:05
I mean, cutting
was cool to see, but, like,

01:06:18:05 - 01:06:20:19
I feel like we watched you build a roof,
you know, in your mind.

01:06:20:22 - 01:06:21:21
Oh, yeah.

01:06:22:00 - 01:06:24:15
Yeah. Yeah. The roof.

01:06:24:15 - 01:06:27:07
It's always
there. It's always in your head.

01:06:27:07 - 01:06:30:16
Speaking from a roof
color, uh, standpoint, that's

01:06:32:04 - 01:06:33:13
I, I think we're maybe

01:06:33:13 - 01:06:36:13
I don't want to use the term
a rare breed or a dying breed,

01:06:36:13 - 01:06:38:23
but I think there's some value
and some truth to that.

01:06:39:03 - 01:06:41:06
Now, it's not interesting to everybody.

01:06:41:06 - 01:06:46:06
So framing carpenters generally that I
that I know in my personal life

01:06:46:06 - 01:06:52:01
and have seen on social media platforms,
everybody enjoys the roof.

01:06:52:08 - 01:06:53:21
That's the only part that's different.

01:06:53:21 - 01:06:56:11
So yeah, you build it.

01:06:56:21 - 01:07:01:09
You build
it first few times, quite a few times.

01:07:01:09 - 01:07:02:19
It's always there.

01:07:02:19 - 01:07:06:01
Um, and then the next drawing comes in

01:07:06:01 - 01:07:10:01
and that roof you just finished, kind of
it doesn't go away.

01:07:10:02 - 01:07:11:20
It still creeps back in.

01:07:11:20 - 01:07:15:18
You'll notice similarities
with the next house.

01:07:16:01 - 01:07:18:10
Certain numbers will jump out
and you'll say, Hey, that was

01:07:18:17 - 01:07:22:03
that was the same span from two roofs ago
or the last roof.

01:07:22:03 - 01:07:24:05
So it's kind of always lingering.

01:07:24:05 - 01:07:28:00
And it seems like the file
cabinet will hold several, three

01:07:28:00 - 01:07:32:05
or four roofs at a time
some mornings I'll come in. I

01:07:33:15 - 01:07:35:22
finally got a hold and then I morning.

01:07:36:12 - 01:07:40:21
Some mornings I'll come in to the shop
during the cutting phase

01:07:41:06 - 01:07:46:17
and I'll set up my gauges on my square
to a pitch from two or three roofs ago.

01:07:46:17 - 01:07:49:06
It's just still in my mind, you know.

01:07:49:06 - 01:07:51:11
So a lot of little things like that.

01:07:52:22 - 01:07:54:23
I always chuckle at myself.

01:07:55:08 - 01:07:58:23
I'll remember a certain dimension
for weeks.

01:07:59:04 - 01:08:03:05
We'll be eating dinner at home,
thinking about, you know, 33 foot

01:08:03:05 - 01:08:07:16
five and 5/8, because that was a span
that was so important to me

01:08:08:11 - 01:08:11:07
that we got right
because it affected so many other parts

01:08:11:07 - 01:08:15:09
that it just kind of burned
into my brain for, you know, a small time.

01:08:15:09 - 01:08:21:09
But yeah, it's definitely very,
very mental

01:08:21:18 - 01:08:25:04
sort of a profession or task.

01:08:25:17 - 01:08:26:23
What does that breakdown like that?

01:08:26:23 - 01:08:29:10
Like how how much mental,
how much physical.

01:08:29:10 - 01:08:31:12
What Well, it's both. Yes, it's

01:08:32:12 - 01:08:34:04
it's very I don't want to use

01:08:34:04 - 01:08:37:23
the term taxing because I enjoy it,
but it is it's stressful, right?

01:08:37:23 - 01:08:41:04
I mean, the stakes are high
you've you have

01:08:42:10 - 01:08:44:13
thousands of dollars of material

01:08:45:10 - 01:08:47:18
that you're responsible for cutting

01:08:47:18 - 01:08:51:09
and that brings its own level of stress.

01:08:51:09 - 01:08:56:00
However, at this point,
you have a level of confidence

01:08:56:13 - 01:08:59:14
that it's going to work.

01:08:59:14 - 01:09:01:19
You've done it time and time again.

01:09:01:19 - 01:09:04:08
However, with that being said,
I'm never comfortable.

01:09:05:05 - 01:09:06:10
Always

01:09:07:04 - 01:09:09:16
I'm comfortable in my

01:09:09:16 - 01:09:12:02
SO then it becomes monitoring myself.

01:09:12:02 - 01:09:15:00
And how focused are you?

01:09:15:00 - 01:09:16:16
For example,

01:09:17:14 - 01:09:20:21
as I mentioned earlier,
when I'm in the calculating process,

01:09:21:09 - 01:09:24:17
I'll sit at this drawing
table for hours, several days.

01:09:24:17 - 01:09:29:08
Sometimes I will find myself
drifting out of what I'm doing.

01:09:29:08 - 01:09:32:17
I'm doing it, I'm hitting my calculator,
I'm filling up my notebook,

01:09:32:17 - 01:09:35:12
and I'll be thinking about something else.

01:09:36:08 - 01:09:37:05
I have to get up.

01:09:37:05 - 01:09:39:09
I'll pace around the shop for 20 minutes.

01:09:39:23 - 01:09:42:04
I'll go outside some fresh air.

01:09:42:04 - 01:09:44:14
Sit down for a minute,
then I'll come back to it.

01:09:45:15 - 01:09:47:21
I'll double check what I was working on.

01:09:47:21 - 01:09:50:00
Sometimes I find mistakes and I say,

01:09:50:00 - 01:09:53:11
Well, boy, I'm glad that you, you know,
you took a break because I would have

01:09:53:12 - 01:09:56:02
I would have been bad guys
want to let you live that down.

01:09:56:10 - 01:10:00:01
The mistakes are never huge

01:10:00:01 - 01:10:03:03
because of the way
I've laid this system out.

01:10:03:03 - 01:10:05:07
It's hard to not catch them.

01:10:05:07 - 01:10:08:21
You know, that's from day one,
going out to the job, transferring

01:10:08:21 - 01:10:12:14
the marks over to the blueprints,
handing that over to the crew.

01:10:12:20 - 01:10:15:15
All of those things ensure it's a double

01:10:15:15 - 01:10:17:23
check, triple check the whole way. So

01:10:19:01 - 01:10:21:03
but it's very stressful,

01:10:21:21 - 01:10:24:00
but it's a good stress because it's fun.

01:10:24:22 - 01:10:27:17
So and I think people by nature

01:10:28:11 - 01:10:31:21
always perform better under pressure
that it's easy.

01:10:31:21 - 01:10:34:23
You don't try as hard right
if you get up to the plate and you know

01:10:34:23 - 01:10:37:23
you're going to hit a homerun
every time, how boring would that be?

01:10:39:05 - 01:10:40:08
Would be boring.

01:10:40:08 - 01:10:42:23
So that that stress is okay.

01:10:42:23 - 01:10:45:12
And I like kind
of having a fire underneath me.

01:10:45:13 - 01:10:50:15
He keeps me, keeps me sharp.

01:10:50:15 - 01:10:53:05
That I mean, that's a great
I mean, you almost answer my next question

01:10:53:05 - 01:10:55:17
are you did answering my next question,
which is basically like,

01:10:56:07 - 01:10:59:18
you know, like I just think of like this
as being like a very,

01:10:59:18 - 01:11:04:15
very pressure ful situation,
you know, like roofing, a lot of pressure.

01:11:04:19 - 01:11:07:02
I mean, there's a lot of money.
There's a lot at stake.

01:11:07:02 - 01:11:11:01
Like you said, um, it's got to work
and it's got to fit.

01:11:11:11 - 01:11:14:19
And so, like, my question would be like,
how do you handle that pressure?

01:11:14:19 - 01:11:16:11
And I think it's, you know,

01:11:16:11 - 01:11:17:13
certainly the methodology

01:11:17:13 - 01:11:20:10
that yeah, it's almost like
you've learned to rely on yourself

01:11:20:16 - 01:11:24:14
and you have to rely on the math
and your experience.

01:11:24:14 - 01:11:26:02
So I'm wondering if you can

01:11:27:02 - 01:11:28:19
just talk about like how you handle

01:11:28:19 - 01:11:32:14
pressure, how you handle that stress.

01:11:32:14 - 01:11:34:02
So yeah,

01:11:34:22 - 01:11:37:05
there is a lot at stake
and the pressures are

01:11:37:21 - 01:11:40:15
a lot.

01:11:40:15 - 01:11:42:17
It's not always easy.

01:11:42:17 - 01:11:45:02
Sometimes that puts me in.

01:11:46:12 - 01:11:48:13
I don't want to say a bad mood,
but I'm a human.

01:11:48:13 - 01:11:49:17
A bad mood, right?

01:11:49:17 - 01:11:53:23
I come home after a long day and
or the weather was bad or for what I or I.

01:11:54:04 - 01:11:55:09
I made a big mistake.

01:11:55:09 - 01:11:58:13
And I'm my own worst critic, so

01:12:00:01 - 01:12:02:18
it's not always easy. But

01:12:02:18 - 01:12:05:16
as interesting as it may sound,

01:12:05:16 - 01:12:07:17
it's kind of a self-reliant,

01:12:07:17 - 01:12:10:17
self-soothing, sort of coping mechanism.

01:12:11:03 - 01:12:14:18
I feel most comfortable
when my tool belt is on,

01:12:15:05 - 01:12:19:18
when I'm staring at a roof plan
or I have a sore on my hands SO

01:12:21:15 - 01:12:24:20
I may carry
those stresses home with me for one night.

01:12:25:00 - 01:12:28:08
But the very next morning
when I have the radio going

01:12:28:08 - 01:12:32:09
and I'm cutting or whatever
it is, it just kind of all goes away.

01:12:33:02 - 01:12:35:20
And I fall right back into that feeling of

01:12:36:09 - 01:12:40:15
of passion and, you know, that drive to

01:12:41:16 - 01:12:44:20
to really push yourself and

01:12:45:12 - 01:12:51:11
handling stress is different for everyone.

01:12:51:11 - 01:12:55:04
My kids keep me pretty busy, so
I don't really I don't have a lot of time

01:12:55:04 - 01:12:57:22
to feel stress when I live here, so

01:12:58:16 - 01:13:01:06
I kind of handle
it and burn it off at the same time.

01:13:01:22 - 01:13:06:18
As I said, if I, if I,
if I notice I've miscalculated something

01:13:06:18 - 01:13:10:04
and I didn't catch it
for like a whole section of roof.

01:13:10:04 - 01:13:10:20
And there it is.

01:13:10:20 - 01:13:13:12
It shows up and I'm like,
Wait a minute, that should be this. Or

01:13:14:20 - 01:13:15:05
I'll get

01:13:15:05 - 01:13:18:02
up and I'll pace around and I'm like,
That's a bummer.

01:13:18:07 - 01:13:21:07
I'll have to use an eraser,
you know, big deal.

01:13:21:07 - 01:13:23:08
It's not like everything's
cut at that point.

01:13:23:13 - 01:13:27:14
So the stress is kind of gone after

01:13:27:14 - 01:13:31:00
I've began cutting because I have double,
triple checked everything.

01:13:31:15 - 01:13:35:07
Now I'll make I'll make human errors
during the cutting.

01:13:35:07 - 01:13:40:05
I'll, I'll cut the wrong bevel or
I'll cut it backwards, things like that.

01:13:40:05 - 01:13:41:09
That's always going to happen.

01:13:41:09 - 01:13:44:21
I mean, there's hundreds of rafters
on every house.

01:13:44:21 - 01:13:48:17
And I think, as I mentioned
in one of my courses,

01:13:48:17 - 01:13:51:20
I've never got 100% on a roof,

01:13:52:13 - 01:13:56:15
a lot of nineties, upper nineties,
but I have never aced one, so to say.

01:13:56:23 - 01:14:02:09
And I like that because as said,
how how boring would that be

01:14:02:09 - 01:14:07:02
if every time it was just perfect
it wouldn't be any fun, you know?

01:14:07:04 - 01:14:11:16
And every time I cut a roof
I leave the shop, I turn the light off.

01:14:11:16 - 01:14:13:14
I know tomorrow we're delivering it.

01:14:13:14 - 01:14:15:17
I think I got 100.

01:14:15:17 - 01:14:19:14
So then I get excited and eager
and we started putting the roof together

01:14:19:17 - 01:14:23:19
and we've gotten them together down
to like the last 20 rafters.

01:14:24:04 - 01:14:25:08
And sure enough,

01:14:25:08 - 01:14:29:15
hey, you got the bubbles
backwards on these three jacks, right now.

01:14:29:20 - 01:14:31:06
See, I just can't get one right,

01:14:32:11 - 01:14:33:05
but it's an easy

01:14:33:05 - 01:14:36:03
fix, you know,
we just switch the bubbles. And

01:14:37:06 - 01:14:39:10
so, yeah, it's

01:14:40:04 - 01:14:43:07
if you follow the system
that I've they've shared

01:14:44:18 - 01:14:46:10
the stress.

01:14:46:10 - 01:14:47:23
The stress will be there the whole time.

01:14:47:23 - 01:14:50:07
But The more you understand it,
the more efficient

01:14:50:07 - 01:14:51:00
you're going to be at it.

01:14:51:00 - 01:14:54:19
And I'm telling you,
I make mistakes, okay?

01:14:55:03 - 01:14:57:10
We just have to be

01:14:57:18 - 01:14:59:07
concise about what we're doing.

01:14:59:07 - 01:15:02:02
We have to be focused, okay?

01:15:03:02 - 01:15:05:17
You can't
you can't be somewhere else mentally.

01:15:06:14 - 01:15:09:10
You have to be ready to sit down
and focus on what you're doing.

01:15:10:04 - 01:15:12:13
I think so.

01:15:12:13 - 01:15:15:10
I guess the long answer, short
answer of all that is

01:15:15:10 - 01:15:18:23
I handle my stress with stress,
if that makes sense.

01:15:19:16 - 01:15:21:19
It stresses me out to be stressed out.

01:15:21:19 - 01:15:24:13
So I go to work and I feel better.

01:15:25:06 - 01:15:25:13
Yeah.

01:15:26:18 - 01:15:28:15
I mean, you plan, your plan or do.

01:15:28:15 - 01:15:29:17
I play a guitar?

01:15:29:17 - 01:15:31:15
That's what I should have said if I.

01:15:31:15 - 01:15:34:15
What I heard here
was if you're stressed at work, have kids.

01:15:35:00 - 01:15:38:12
Yeah, yes, have kids.

01:15:38:14 - 01:15:40:17
The more the merrier. I love kids.

01:15:40:23 - 01:15:41:09
Yeah.

01:15:41:09 - 01:15:45:23
Most important part of my life.

01:15:45:23 - 01:15:46:04
Yeah.

01:15:46:04 - 01:15:49:04
Stress is, you know,
that's different for everyone.

01:15:49:04 - 01:15:51:10
So that's a that's a tough one to answer.

01:15:51:10 - 01:15:54:03
I'd like to tell you,
I you know, I'll just I'll go home

01:15:54:03 - 01:15:59:12
and I'll crush a 30 pack of beer
and I feel way better.

01:15:59:12 - 01:16:02:17
Yeah, right.

01:16:02:17 - 01:16:05:06
So cool.

01:16:05:06 - 01:16:08:02
Yeah, I've got I've got one, one
kind of last question in my head

01:16:08:02 - 01:16:11:02
and feel free to riff on
anything that we haven't touched on.

01:16:11:02 - 01:16:11:14
Right.

01:16:11:15 - 01:16:15:07
Um, you know, you were talking
a little bit earlier throughout the week,

01:16:15:10 - 01:16:21:03
you know that, um, you know, some,
sometimes our ideas of success and any in

01:16:21:03 - 01:16:22:10
anything that we do is fortune

01:16:22:10 - 01:16:25:19
and fame and the biggest and best
and top of the top dog.

01:16:26:07 - 01:16:29:05
That is better off, too,
but I love how you were describing

01:16:29:05 - 01:16:32:09
kind of like the modified vision
for for your for your life,

01:16:32:09 - 01:16:35:14
your career and your legacy,
which is basically where you're at.

01:16:35:14 - 01:16:41:03
So I'd love to hear more about
like how you, how you define success, um,

01:16:41:04 - 01:16:46:22
and what you do
and kind of the hopes for your legacy.

01:16:46:22 - 01:16:47:12
I think

01:16:49:04 - 01:16:49:21
success,

01:16:49:21 - 01:16:52:21
you know, being a successful person,

01:16:52:21 - 01:16:54:23
that's perceived many different ways.

01:16:55:06 - 01:16:58:23
Some people being successful is
you have $1,000,000

01:16:58:23 - 01:17:01:13
in the bank
and some people are more simple.

01:17:02:02 - 01:17:06:19
Being successful to others
is I have a hot meal on the table today.

01:17:06:19 - 01:17:09:21
That's a pretty broad spectrum.

01:17:09:21 - 01:17:11:00
I guess my take on success,

01:17:11:00 - 01:17:12:20
I guess my take on success,

01:17:13:07 - 01:17:15:21
there's many levels of it

01:17:15:21 - 01:17:18:07
to speak directly towards framing.

01:17:18:07 - 01:17:19:16
Carpenter

01:17:20:05 - 01:17:23:06
Don't fall into that

01:17:23:06 - 01:17:26:23
thought or ideal
that for me to be successful,

01:17:26:23 - 01:17:30:06
I need to own my own framing company.

01:17:30:06 - 01:17:35:04
I need to be the boss, I need to have 15
trucks and I want a TV commercial.

01:17:35:04 - 01:17:36:16
So that's great.

01:17:36:16 - 01:17:40:01
If you get to that level,
that is certainly successful.

01:17:41:22 - 01:17:44:08
But I won't respect you anymore.

01:17:44:08 - 01:17:47:03
Then I'll respect the 35 year old man

01:17:47:03 - 01:17:51:01
who's came to work every day
and he's the top dog on that job site.

01:17:51:07 - 01:17:52:15
He may not own the company.

01:17:53:19 - 01:17:55:03
That's not what impresses me.

01:17:55:03 - 01:17:57:12
What impresses me about that other guy

01:17:57:12 - 01:18:01:02
is he has the wherewithal
and the know how and he shows his passion.

01:18:01:12 - 01:18:04:01
To me that is successful.

01:18:04:13 - 01:18:07:08
I don't think there's a ceiling,

01:18:07:13 - 01:18:10:00
if you will, on the ladder of success

01:18:10:12 - 01:18:12:13
in the in our framing world.

01:18:13:01 - 01:18:15:05
I think that can be looked
at many different ways.

01:18:15:05 - 01:18:19:02
If money is your end goal, then
that's how you will measure your success.

01:18:19:12 - 01:18:22:14
If knowledge and understanding
is your end goal, then

01:18:23:02 - 01:18:26:04
that'll be your skill for success.

01:18:26:04 - 01:18:31:00
I tend not to judge a book by its cover
because I've met some interesting people

01:18:31:00 - 01:18:34:03
in this line of work
every walk of life, as I've mentioned so

01:18:35:04 - 01:18:37:12
I think there's small triumphs every day

01:18:37:23 - 01:18:41:02
that we should all recognize
when they happen.

01:18:41:23 - 01:18:44:19
Kind of throw that in your bag of life

01:18:44:19 - 01:18:48:05
experience, but
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

01:18:48:10 - 01:18:49:09
That's the other thing

01:18:50:13 - 01:18:51:20
to me.

01:18:52:02 - 01:18:53:21
I feel

01:18:54:09 - 01:18:55:18
successful.

01:18:55:18 - 01:18:58:06
I as a carpenter, I,

01:18:58:06 - 01:19:00:19
I was interested
in reframing my whole career.

01:19:00:19 - 01:19:03:07
I've I've brought myself to a level

01:19:04:19 - 01:19:07:02
that I never thought I would ever get to.

01:19:07:02 - 01:19:12:10
And now I have this opportunity
to share this with hopefully many others.

01:19:12:17 - 01:19:13:23
To me

01:19:14:19 - 01:19:16:22
you couldn't put a price on that.

01:19:16:22 - 01:19:20:13
So I think successes

01:19:21:16 - 01:19:24:14
there's levels of it and it's just a

01:19:26:18 - 01:19:29:12
it's a way of thinking
like like I said in my course, you know,

01:19:30:07 - 01:19:34:19
yeah, money and fame and fortune
and being popular,

01:19:34:21 - 01:19:37:22
you know, like, you know, a high school
kid to be successful,

01:19:37:22 - 01:19:40:03
he wants to be the most popular person
there. Right?

01:19:40:14 - 01:19:41:19
He gets out of high school.

01:19:41:19 - 01:19:45:06
Success to him might be, man,
if I could afford a car.

01:19:45:07 - 01:19:45:15
Right.

01:19:45:15 - 01:19:48:19
Gets a car now he's he's successful
and we should always be reaching.

01:19:50:05 - 01:19:52:23
I don't think as a human being

01:19:54:08 - 01:19:56:01
it should be about money.

01:19:56:01 - 01:19:58:07
If that is a fruit of your labor,

01:19:59:14 - 01:20:00:16
that's just a reward.

01:20:00:16 - 01:20:02:07
That's part of it.

01:20:02:07 - 01:20:05:15
So if you take my courses

01:20:05:15 - 01:20:08:06
as an effort to increase your productivity

01:20:09:01 - 01:20:12:04
and that brings you more money,
that's a bonus, right?

01:20:12:20 - 01:20:16:01
More importantly,
I would say you're successful

01:20:16:01 - 01:20:19:17
because you learned it, you understood it,
and that was just an end result.

01:20:20:09 - 01:20:23:23
I wouldn't let the money side define that,
but that's just me.

01:20:24:14 - 01:20:26:10
I'm a humble, simple person.

01:20:26:10 - 01:20:27:21
I'm a carpenter.

01:20:28:08 - 01:20:30:19
Me. You don't get much more simple
than guys like me.

01:20:31:07 - 01:20:36:06
We launch on piles of wood.

01:20:36:06 - 01:20:37:13
Is very complex.

01:20:37:13 - 01:20:38:10
Now, as I understand.

01:20:38:10 - 01:20:39:17
It, they all hell yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:39:17 - 01:20:40:14
It, they all hell yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:40:14 - 01:20:41:17
I can't walk on water.

01:20:41:17 - 01:20:44:16
That would be interesting.

01:20:44:16 - 01:20:46:12
What what do you hope you leave behind?

01:20:47:22 - 01:20:50:04
I hope that

01:20:50:04 - 01:20:50:12
if I.

01:20:50:12 - 01:20:55:20
If I had a legacy,
so to speak, that it was

01:20:56:22 - 01:20:59:02
someone would maybe watch these

01:20:59:14 - 01:21:02:22
or any of the things I've shared
with teaching and

01:21:03:23 - 01:21:05:22
take away.

01:21:06:16 - 01:21:10:17
Wow. That guy loved framing.

01:21:11:15 - 01:21:12:20
He loved it.

01:21:12:20 - 01:21:17:07
You could see it.

01:21:17:07 - 01:21:18:16
He enjoyed every part of it.

01:21:18:16 - 01:21:21:03
It was it was part of who he was. And

01:21:22:15 - 01:21:25:03
it's so great
that he put all this out here

01:21:26:05 - 01:21:27:17
for us, you know?

01:21:27:17 - 01:21:31:19
And if that can stick around
and people can take

01:21:32:19 - 01:21:37:18
an education from me or share in a passion

01:21:38:10 - 01:21:43:15
or at least an appreciation of what
it takes to go out in a hot, scalding

01:21:43:15 - 01:21:46:19
sun and the snowstorms
and all the things we do

01:21:47:15 - 01:21:50:17
just to perform our job

01:21:50:17 - 01:21:53:09
would be the ultimate honor

01:21:53:09 - 01:21:55:15
to look at a carpenter

01:21:56:12 - 01:22:00:16
and really appreciate the amount
of his soul that it takes

01:22:01:23 - 01:22:03:21
to perform his job.

01:22:03:21 - 01:22:05:15
That would be

01:22:07:05 - 01:22:11:03
my ultimate goal.

01:22:11:03 - 01:22:14:15
Above and beyond the education is to share

01:22:16:00 - 01:22:17:19
what it really is to be

01:22:17:19 - 01:22:23:07
a tradesperson. Wow.

01:22:23:14 - 01:22:28:05
In. Yeah, he rendered me speechless.

01:22:28:05 - 01:22:29:20
So, um.

01:22:29:20 - 01:22:30:09
What else?

01:22:30:09 - 01:22:34:05
What else would you like to share?

01:22:34:05 - 01:22:36:15
I don't know.

01:22:36:15 - 01:22:38:11
Don't know
if there's anything at this point.

01:22:38:11 - 01:22:48:07
I just made myself speechless.

01:22:48:07 - 01:22:51:07
I'm grateful for all.

01:22:51:13 - 01:22:56:12
I'm grateful for the life
that this line of work has provided me.

01:22:57:04 - 01:22:59:11
You know I don't have a,

01:22:59:22 - 01:23:02:15
you know, race cars and speedboats
and a mansion on the hill.

01:23:02:15 - 01:23:05:06
But I have

01:23:05:06 - 01:23:08:17
some really great friends
that I'll have the rest of my life.

01:23:09:08 - 01:23:11:00
I have some great stories.

01:23:11:00 - 01:23:16:12
I have a particular set of skills
that took me half of my life

01:23:16:21 - 01:23:20:06
to learn.

01:23:20:06 - 01:23:21:09
It's all been worth it.

01:23:21:09 - 01:23:24:00
The good and the bad. I'll take it.
I wouldn't change any of it.

01:23:25:16 - 01:23:28:13
And I'm grateful for

01:23:28:13 - 01:23:30:04
this opportunity.

01:23:30:04 - 01:23:32:03
You know, I feel like

01:23:32:19 - 01:23:36:20
for me, touching back on success, to me,

01:23:36:20 - 01:23:41:13
this is this is a level of success for me
that I,

01:23:42:15 - 01:23:45:20
up until April, never would have imagined

01:23:46:10 - 01:23:48:21
that my voice could get so big

01:23:49:11 - 01:23:53:16
to share in what is so simple
and silly to me framing houses.

01:23:53:16 - 01:23:55:20
It's just that's just my day to day life

01:23:56:17 - 01:23:59:22
and to get to teach what I'm doing
and, potentially

01:24:01:08 - 01:24:02:07
reach

01:24:02:23 - 01:24:05:09
other people like myself and give them

01:24:06:21 - 01:24:09:17
a piece of my soul.

01:24:09:17 - 01:24:11:16
That's the good stuff.

01:24:12:12 - 01:24:14:01
That's really

01:24:14:21 - 01:24:15:22
that's special.

01:24:15:22 - 01:24:19:10
I'll never, ever, ever be able beat this.

01:24:20:04 - 01:24:21:09
This is it.

01:24:22:12 - 01:24:25:03
So it's been an awesome experience.

01:24:26:02 - 01:24:29:11
I'm so grateful for all of it
I'm grateful.

01:24:29:11 - 01:24:32:10
And now that we're through this, I'm

01:24:33:02 - 01:24:35:14
I'm looking forward to a regular workweek

01:24:35:14 - 01:24:39:15
where I don't have Joey and Alfie
and all these guys in my face, but

01:24:40:16 - 01:24:43:05
I've really loved every second of it.

01:24:43:05 - 01:24:45:23
You know, I called my father, I talked to him.

01:24:47:07 - 01:24:49:02
Actually, I didn't call him.

01:24:49:07 - 01:24:51:17
I sent him a few pictures and

01:24:51:17 - 01:24:56:02
we exchanged a few texts and he told me, enjoy all of these moments, son.

01:24:56:09 - 01:24:58:13
And I did just that.

01:24:59:02 - 01:25:01:22
I took a lot of screenshots in my brain,

01:25:03:18 - 01:25:06:01
so it'll be weird

01:25:06:01 - 01:25:08:15
walking in here next week and all this stuff is gone.

01:25:09:08 - 01:25:13:11
It's going to be different, but it's been great and I appreciate all of it.

01:25:13:11 - 01:25:17:13
And I hopefully, hopefully we help some carpenters, right?

01:25:17:13 - 01:25:20:03
That's our end goal. So let it rip.

01:25:20:15 - 01:25:22:01
Get it out there.

01:25:22:03 - 01:25:23:14
Favorite. The only.

01:25:24:01 - 01:25:27:03
Thing. Oh,

01:25:29:07 - 01:25:30:06
you never know, man.

01:25:30:06 - 01:25:30:13
You might.
