# Sady Tell

0:05
Hello.

0:09
Hello Diamond.

0:13
Hello how's it going?

0:16
Nice to meet you.

0:19
Okay let me Joys of a different platform.

0:25
I don't know what to use this one I'm just gonna have to just make sure my settings are set up the sound, right, headphones so working.

0:43
Yeah there we go, brilliant.

0:46
Right sorry about that.

0:47
I don't normally use google's quick crash course then.

0:50
No worries.

0:51
No worries.

0:51
Nice to meet you.

0:52
Yeah.

0:53
Yeah.

0:54
Yeah.

0:54
Very good.

0:55
Good apologies.

0:56
I'm I've literally just flown in from the from the gym so I'm not looking at my best.

1:03
Bedraggled.

1:04
Yeah no worries.

1:06
Cool.

1:07
Yeah I guess there's a quick background then.

1:08
I'm jacking one of the founders of Jeannie.

1:10
Yeah I've been working on it for coming up three years.

1:14
In terms of what we do we build a product to help students and researchers get all their reading done faster.

1:21
So it's basically like google drive, I'll just give you a quick demo.

1:27
You can oh steve so you can basically upload a document to it and then you get these these kind of like summary overviews for each one of your documents.

1:50
And if you wanna see like a kind of description of like the yeah the the sort of like key points within get back from that.

2:02
Yeah key points within any any part of this document.

2:04
You click on the drop down and it will generate a sort of a i summary for you.

2:10
So you can read it faster.

2:11
You click on any of these bullet points it will actually before you and I will show you where in the document they came from.

2:19
and then once you decided to read it further, you can add it to a project.

2:22
This has got quite a few documents in at this point.

2:26
And then you can use the sort of search features as well to kind of continue digging into this resource or or any any other, so you can use it to answer questions.

2:36
Let me just an example of that.

2:38
So yeah, with this one we can ask it, I don't know what is E.

2:44
R.

2:48
Okay, so it's given us one answer that we can probably, it doesn't look like it actually defines it in this paper, so we can ask you something more specific, like what type of of camera was used.

3:06
Okay, so it's using a smartphone camera and you can kind of click on these and see where the document it got that from.

3:13
You can also ask more complex questions and it can write answers for you.

3:17
like what is a transformer model.

3:20
And all of these are based on the content that you've uploaded.

3:26
So it will use a, you know, use other documents, other documents within the project to answer that.

3:33
And you can you can kind of look through these sources and sort of see where it's where it's getting its information from.

3:39
So that's basically Jeannie in terms of you know sort of yeah, like what we're up to you as a business, like we're generating reasonable revenue from from students and researchers, but we've kind of found that as a market they're not particularly like financially viable basically to serve with products like they do have problems like that are, you know, time pressure and that kind of thing, but they didn't have loads of money to spend on on solutions.

4:12
So we've I think we've, you know, we've picked out pretty reasonable revenue off the back of them, but at the moment we're kind of looking to see whether there's like a a more sort of viable like professional market where we could kind of apply the technology, we've developed the platform to, you know, to serve a use case that might be more sort of I guess more of a financial pain point for somebody rather than like a kind of lifestyle choice, if that makes sense.

4:40
And so the the area area was sort of interesting really, is around like consulting and like qualitative research really.

4:47
And so we were kind of just hoping to speak to a few people in those areas and kind of see what their pain points are and what the process is on how we might be able to speed that up.

4:57
Okay, so just so I'm clear so you're you're looking for research in that area to understand that opportunity for you as a business?

5:08
Yeah.

5:08
Yeah.

5:09
So we're looking to kind of speak to a few whole consultants I people like yourself who you know you kind of spend a lot of time doing your research in various forms on a kind of corporate level to try and understand like where where we might be able to add value.

5:25
Okay so I I mean I'd say you're you're better off to try and talk to different working groups of people to pick into where this becomes viable for them.

5:46
So for example last year did a project for tide the online banking sector again, talking to people across sort of small business holders, so people that were self employed people that had small limited companies and that really about understanding where the opportunities were, you know where the gaps were.

6:10
Yeah, I suppose what I'm just trying to understand from you, Jack is are you just asking me to give you a bit of rain dumped off the top of my head as to what I think, why are you asking me to do some research for you?

6:22
I just I just want to be clear, probably the former.

6:25
But I mean yeah like I think yeah the position where we're just trying to figure out whether this is like worth pursuing further, really validate that I think as a as a research myself as a business.

6:44
Oh no, I think that the ability to still large information is helpful to be able to do that.

6:53
So, you know, for a research perspective when you've got a lot of volume coming through to be able to distill that down into more dilute hable chunks is helpful, especially when you're looking at sort of almost like doing summaries, top line summaries of what you're going through my area is more qualitative that I do.

7:15
I work with quantum researchers as well.

7:17
I'm not sure how this would work for them if I'm honest.

7:22
I can't really speak for quant perspective.

7:24
I think from a qualitative perspective and large amounts of data that this yeah, I'm sure this could be helpful from a my previous life in marketing Brandon when I was a test guys for about 27 years before doing this.

7:41
Again, that ability to still large pieces of background data, historical things that may be a business has done over the years of being able to distill that down to sensing points is actually probably quite helpful again.

7:59
So I probably, if you're asking me off the top of my head, the audience additional for you, I'd probably say we've probably been marketing a brand professionals.

8:09
I'm sure that would be helpful, you know, from a research perspective.

8:14
Again, that could be the the sort of technology, I'm sure can be quite helpful as well in that respect as well.

8:21
What's your what's your process like?

8:23
So you describe that project were tied before?

8:26
Like how does it, how did that kind of you know, like I guess like what were the stages involved?

8:31
And yeah and what was like I guess the question you were trying to answer, that kind of thing for them really was about there, it was about understanding their end users and how they fell out across a broad spectrum of small sort of self employed business owners.

8:54
and really trying to, it was about initially it was about to a spectrum of people across a broad mix of ages, lifestyles, salaries duration of businesses start up through two more established and and it was about understanding that sort of trail that people go along from starting up a business to more established and how that sort of evolves.

9:23
And that was doing qualitative research.

9:26
So that was doing depth interviews with respondents probably about 19 minutes going through pre sequence of sort of points trying to cover off.

9:36
So there was a lot a lot of data coming through from those conversations.

9:40
Some were keeping diaries for me as well, so tracking what their typical weeks and that looked like.

9:44
So again, a lot of stuff coming through that way, the hardest part of it is still process, you get a gut feel as you go through from repetition of hearing things and the notes that you're taking.

9:56
But again, I think things that I use Otter ai is one of my sources.

10:01
I used to transcribe all my sessions so that keeps me a sort of trail of what was being said, what's going on again similar to what you've got, then I can delve in via subject or or keywords that have come out to sort of go to sections of that.

10:18
And then again, yeah, it's really distilling all that at the end which is obviously my profession, that's where my money is that I charge clients is the time it takes me to distill that information and start pulling out I think on the key issues and what they need to work on as a business sort of that process.

10:36
Last time really went through that sort of understanding the client, understanding their problem producing a proposal then doing the field work and then at the end and then to producing the sort of final presentation.

10:50
Okay.

10:51
And do you like do you how do you how do you kind of get through everything?

10:56
Do you just sort of read, read all of the material?

10:59
Like listen back to transcripts, take notes like what's the process for distilling and and is it like where do you sort of I suppose where you collect everything is in like a big word document or something or like a presentation or I mix a mixture of different things to be honest.

11:14
Like I said it's one of my tools I use for transcribing stuff that I'm doing craft and I'll create sort of Excel spreadsheets and almost pillar Subjects topics as I go through so that at least if I'm going through 30 interviews with someone it follows some sort of correlation so I can start seeing where things a line some of the subjects.

11:37
Again it's yeah sometimes it really depends what sometimes it's handwritten notes you know it can be reading through a lot of stuff going back over it, listening to video, listening to audio.

11:48
Okay interesting.

11:49
And do you do use any other tools other than other than author?

11:52
I guess in that in that process?

11:55
Not really.

11:56
I mean the other stuff I use is basic sort of Microsoft packages, stuff like that you know nothing particularly exciting to be honest.

12:08
Okay and like I suppose during that process like do you like what's the is the majority does the majority of the time that you go into like the I guess like I suppose there are like different stages that really I suppose you have to like find leads right?

12:30
Like people to speak to.

12:32
I guess you gotta chat to them, carry out the data collection, carry out the synthesis.

12:37
Check in with with the clients.

12:39
I suppose you're working too like I suppose the question really is like where's the majority of your time going I guess And it is that like a is that a concern for you like how long something takes or be more focused on like quality and deadlines are sort of flexible for me, you know, a lot of work goes in up front about about making sure that I'm really precise about the deadlines and deliverables and when they need, when they need to be, they're the, you know, the majority of the time really is fieldwork.

13:09
Fieldwork takes up a lot more time interviewing people discussing things following people around.

13:14
I mean, I do love types of research, anything from depth interviews to sort of experimental accompanied shops walk around, you know, whatever.

13:27
So the big block is the field work and then the bigger block of spaces at the end of the cylinder is doing the field work and it is teasing all apart and working out what what the narrative is, what the story is, you're going to get back to the okay.

13:40
And do you tend to work like with a larger team, I guess with other people from organization or other?

13:48
I'll be honest, it's just this is my business.

13:52
I started up about 12 months ago, I worked with other freelancers, so I've got quite a network of freelancers that I worked with.

14:00
I used to work agency side got made redundant during the pandemic.

14:04
Never thought about running my own business.

14:06
And everyone kept saying, Oh you should do it.

14:07
And I eventually gave in and thought what the hell I do it and actually really join, it's been a great 12 months.

14:14
But yeah, I've got really good network of freelancers that I interact with, I can put them in as and when I need them on projects, spending that big, how small it is.

14:23
So I don't I don't have that, those trappings of excuse me of an office and all the other bits to go with it.

14:30
Yeah.

14:31
And like, excuse me, do you have to like and what's it like, I guess kind of collaborating with them, Do you like share stuff when you're working with them as a team?

14:40
Yeah, we've got shared drives and stuff that we use together.

14:44
I'm not completely the the root of having them use the same sort of email addresses and stuff.

14:52
I'm always very transparent with my clients and say, look, I'm working with other freelancers.

14:55
They're not, I trust them, but they're not part of.

15:00
What do these freelancers, again?

15:05
It really paints.

15:06
Sometimes I need support fieldwork, you know, might be in different areas of the country and I just might not be able to get there myself and then jump in and do it.

15:13
I work with I'm classically a quality trained research, although I have some sort of quantum background, but it's not it doesn't float my boat.

15:22
It's not my thing.

15:23
I like doing so quite often I have other freelancers that are trained that are pulling to do the heavy lifting on on stuff like that and I'll just oversee it And like, do you do you have a sense as well?

15:40
I suppose if like if it was kind of build a tool in this space, like do you as someone that runs here in business like in terms of the margins and and like are a way for you?

15:53
Like what what what's the, do you have a good sense of like what the budget would be like?

15:58
for how much, how much I could call research might be willing to spend on I guess like on like on tools or products that could speed up the process of completing network.

16:09
It was interesting to look at your your website.

16:12
I mean that that yearly monthly subscription is probably what everyone else does.

16:17
It's what I'd expect to be honest for something like this.

16:21
So I I use we transfer to get into another sort of subscription service, alter ai zoom professional.

16:31
They all sort of tools that I have to use but they're all things that I would expect to pay like a year.

16:37
You know, subscription most range anywhere between 60 and £150 I suppose for a year.

16:44
And they're just sort of things you just click on and they sit in the background and then you just use it as and when you need it sort of thing.

16:49
That's probably how I would imagine your product if I was going to use it.

16:54
You know, if it felt like it was gonna like like I said earlier I probably do some of the heavy lifting for me.

17:00
You know somebody save me some time because quite often times my enemy.

17:04
And if I've got three or four projects on the go that's when things get stressful when you're trying to get through amount of data.

17:10
But you also conscious you gotta dip in and start the other projects as well, checking on something else and so that those things sort of help.

17:18
Yeah.

17:19
Okay interesting.

17:22
Yeah do you do you do much like desk research before getting into these projects?

17:29
Like do you have to read a lot of like background material about the industry personally?

17:35
I I don't I mean other research has offered desk research.

17:39
You know if you are a good source for you to tap into would be the I.

17:44
C.

17:44
G.

17:45
If you've not done the independent consultants group, you're going to have a shed load of people in there like me that are all researchers and run our own businesses but they're all independent researchers.

17:58
So there will be one or two bands.

18:00
There won't be big organizations but that I'd probably say that would be quite an interesting ground.

18:07
Look at, you know, you'd get a lot of opinions about how people would use its relevance to them.

18:14
Yeah basically like this the situation we're in right now like you know there's like you know there's there's there's like six first basically all mostly mostly engineers and product people.

18:26
We built this pretty good tool for for students and like we've we've scaled and got revenue and I think like right now we're just like really hungry to just kind of sink our teeth into like a more professional problem of vertical where we can just apply the tech and so like I think almost what we need really to I guess that I mean there's there's kind of understanding it but also like I guess just finding like a really solid almost like design partner or something you just work with just to sort of like tune it and build something really good.

18:54
Yeah.

18:55
Yeah the I.

18:57
C.

18:57
G.

18:57
Thing sounds really interesting that I hadn't heard of them actually.

19:00
Yeah I'm I'm reaching out to them and having a chat.

19:03
There's I mean there's hundreds of members in there.

19:07
I mean for me I dip in and out of it, I belong to it probably for the last couple of years now they're quite helpful resource of you know they're all opinionated.

19:17
You know people will give you an opinion straight away so you won't be short of opinions on stuff but relevance and stuff and you know if they would use it how they develop it.

19:28
That that that could be potentially an opportunity for you know for me it almost feels like I'm not trying to work myself, it's up to you how you go off and do that but it feels like you need to do some exploratory research on, it's almost like you you want to try and talk to a broad plethora of different businesses so you can start understanding where those growth areas that already opportunities are for you to expand what you're already doing.

19:55
I totally get the researcher and the academic line that you've taken.

20:00
But like you said that those people were going to be limited and resource financially, they're always going to be a bit LTD as well if you get into bigger corporate organizations where people need to distill a lot of information.

20:14
Like I said, brand and marketing teams and stuff like that, you know, directors of these companies is probably where you're gonna make more money, you know, people Yeah, I think I think the I suppose the idea really was like, I mean, I think one thing we liked about it was that I suppose as a group really is that there's a couple of levels and you know, from from what we've kind of seen like there's a similar workflows that go on in like strategy and like management consulting.

20:42
and yeah, I suppose like I think the I guess the the attraction of speaking to like I suppose like freelancers and people such as yourself is that you guys have like the full you control the full the full cycle and like understand like what the like cost implications are, you know, what the difficulties are at all stages rather than, I suppose, some of our friends who have spoken to you work in I guess like, similar research functions, like larger consultancy firms who kind of, they get they kind of get seconded to like, you know, I guess doing, doing that work, but I suppose they don't have a good sense of like, I don't know how how, how their companies even go about, like acquiring these tools or like whether they're allowed to use them or not, and it's very difficult, I guess, to approach them before you have something that, you know, that has a bit of bit of traction, that kind of works.

21:35
Yeah, that that that's Yeah, I think anything like what you're doing, isn't it?

21:40
That that's the biggest barriers and it's a big businesses is, you know, that will be done internally.

21:46
There will normally be teams of people that are, you know, responsible for bringing new things into the business and that, which is yeah, it's gonna be your biggest challenges and they're knocking down that door.

21:59
Yeah.

22:00
What was was the agency that you were working out before?

22:03
Was that was that Austin called?

22:04
Research?

22:05
Yeah, I worked well, I've worked for a couple of years, I worked for, it was a small research, see Qual and Quant I left Tesco's God, when was it?

22:20
About eight years ago now, I think, and I don't want to I bring brand inside marketing and advertising there over the years, over 27 year career.

22:29
And I just wanted to do something else.

22:31
So I joined a small agency and sort of really cut my teeth into that and love my trade, you know, on that other side of the fence, so to speak, which was great.

22:41
And then, yeah, I worked for a big London agency Last year before last, who were the complete opposite end of the spectrum, you know, they were expanded massively.

22:58
So I think they were probably in about 12 different countries now.

23:02
and, and again, that was a great, great experience.

23:04
But I did that on sort of on a short term contract, which, which was great.

23:08
Again, good experience for me, I really enjoyed it, but it just really galvanized my brain to think I want to, I don't want to work for someone else.

23:18
So much having that autonomy and freedom to do what you want to do is you can't go back again.

23:25
Yeah, no, I get that.

23:29
We went straight into a startup.

23:31
So very much very much of that as well.

23:34
Yeah, I mean, I've done over the years, I've done research projects for different startup businesses and one of the ones that stick to my mind was a company was starting up this new, like glasses for people to have partial vision.

23:51
Again, that was really from the ground upwards, but that was, again, I mean, I'm teaching how to suck eggs, but you know, from these sort of people, the early stages really trying to get that wider audience who are going to be your potential end users, like you said, I've got the money to to do it, because obviously that's where you want to sustain your business.

24:12
Is that you want people with money to Yeah, exactly, your product.

24:16
Yeah, I think, yeah, I mean we're kind of, yeah, I mean we're just at this point where like we're very happy to work on solving anyone's like data processing, you know, search, summarization, textual problems just because they're not students.

24:31
So yeah, I suppose the other thing is, well, thinking about it, you know, again, some of the other other projects I've done similar to this, is that the way you describe a problem to someone might not be the way they think about the problem they've got so no disrespect to you guys, but you guys, you were immersed in this, you this is, you know, as soon as she took me through this, you're boom, boom, boom all over this is what it does.

24:57
But actually the real person in the real world might not think about it that way.

25:02
The way their problem is that their mind is slightly different.

25:06
and the way you articulate it to them, that we've got something that solves your problem is half the way of getting them to even consider buying your product or even getting considered that I need this product, you know, sort of thing.

25:18
And sometimes research is great at saying, yeah, this market, thereby do this.

25:25
But actually the way you articulated to them and it doesn't help you make sure that you're really getting across to them that actually this is right, this is something that's for you and it's right and it solves that problem that you've always got to think about.

25:38
You know, I think I think that's what tied did you know the project I did with Tide was really helpful and just them really understanding this is how people that want bank accounts.

25:49
These are the problems they've got these are the things they want from the bank account, these you know, these self employed people, these things they're really passionate about and annoy them and these things, save them time these things make them want to use a product?

26:02
Yeah.

26:03
Yeah, no I think I think that makes sense.

26:09
Okay.

26:10
Yeah,.

26:14
Do you have any thoughts?

26:16
I mean the only thing, the only thing I wanted was interested in really was like diving.

26:22
I don't know how much time we have here, but diving a little bit more into into your your into your qualitative research process because obviously that's your area of specialty.

26:34
I mean would you just mind like walking us through how you actually go about conducting this, this quality of research, like what what does that process look like from, you know, gathering people together to finish.

26:46
So quite often there'd be a kick off meeting with the stakeholders, I'm sure like any other business we would then go through what are their problems?

26:55
What do they want to get from the research?

26:57
What hypothesis do they have about anything that already who who's going to use it?

27:04
How are they going to use it in the business?

27:06
What answers the questions that need to answer?

27:08
What the key objectives from what the business objectives, What are the individuals objectives and blah, blah, blah, blah.

27:13
We go through that to steal that down and then the next stage typically there would be writing content, like a discussion guide or a topic guide of questions to go through with respondents.

27:26
So you obviously would have agreed how we're going to approach the the problem.

27:31
So it could be, you know, like I said, it could be interviews, it could be observations, it could be focused groups, it could be anything, do you know what I mean?

27:39
It could be, but it's really about the structure of questions that need to be asked and putting them in customer speaking basically so that you're not just reading from a textbook and people don't understand what you're talking about.

27:53
You put it in simple jargon that's relevant to the people that you're talking to that then will go through some iterations between the stakeholders that will get signed off.

28:05
That's then something I use in the background, I'll also be doing other things like recruitment.

28:10
So I worked with external recruitment agencies.

28:13
I worked for years that will go out and recruit people for being online interviews or face to face or whatever, sorting out venues and all that sort of stuff that goes up in the background.

28:24
Then you conduct the research whilst you're doing that, you're taking nature, recording it.

28:29
Sometimes you're videoing what's being said as well, that might go through different iterations of doing, you know, week here a week there.

28:38
I've just come back from a few that I've been doing up in leeds in Scotland, all over the place, thanks to all the bloody train strikes that's made my life a bit more entertained.

28:48
But anyway, I've known about that on a different day.

28:50
But yeah, so then then it's it's really like I said, it's getting that all back loading it all up on the pc, collecting everything needs to be done transcribing everything needs to be transcribed and then it's that sifting process, it really is going through and it starts, it's, you know, it can either use an excel spreadsheets to zone things in a way or you know, the other thing can often be doing is editing hours of video because the client will want to see it because some of the things that being said as well.

29:20
So it's editing distilling, it could be bouncing it back and forth.

29:26
So if I'm working with other researchers on it, it could be that we're doing often doing multiple video calls with each other, talking through what we think, start putting framework together for what we think the final presentation will look like.

29:38
So that's getting the skeleton structure in place and start working out the slides and who's gonna do what and where it's going to go and then it really is that whole distilling process, since checking everything, grammar check and everything.

29:52
And then then normally the final presentation back at the end, which again can be an hour, can be a half a day, it can be online, it can be face to face bits at the end as well.

30:07
Does that help?

30:08
Super, super useful.

30:10
Yeah, that's that's that was perfect.

30:11
And like in that process, which part do you find like the most difficult or frustrating or time consuming or the bit that you wish?

30:20
Like I wish I didn't have to do this?

30:27
I want to answer because I actually enjoy what I do in the first way.

30:31
Even the difficult bits I enjoy, what would you say are difficult in that the most difficult.

30:38
It really is still in and getting the inside because the challenge you've got in our business as well, is it very much up front piece of work is about what do you not want to know?

30:50
You know what you already know is a business that if I rock up in two weeks time when I bring this back, you will think, oh God, you've taught me nothing new here.

30:57
You know what what what what are the killer key insights that you're getting out.

31:03
There's something you didn't know, something that's really helpful for you and your business.

31:06
So that I suppose the challenge with your thing as well, it's it's great.

31:11
It can distill stuff, but you really wanted to get those little diamonds, those little nuggets, the things you know that that aren't maybe always obvious but really helpful to get out when you're distilling that information.

31:26
Sometimes it's hard to know yourself because when you're faced with such a sea of data, it's hard to get those little diamonds out of it.

31:35
Sometimes, you know, it's hard to clear all the clutter away and see what really is there.

31:39
What sort of things are they that you the like what the Yeah, I guess what what are these kind of diamonds of information as an example?

31:49
It varies, it could be anything from how the customer really views their brand, how how customers view the brand, how they interact with it, What they wanted to do.

32:04
You know, quite often with clients because a lot of stuff have done the last 12 months between brand development stuff is about they think of their brand one way and they think this is how the world sees their brand.

32:14
And then the reality is when they do the research is only that actually people don't see our brand that way and we've been disillusioned and actually they think of it this way and you know, this is how they actually who they compare their brands with quite often on who other people compare their brands with, because they compare them with different brands, their, their their needs of the brand or how what they think the brand relevance to them is completely different to what the actual brand director or his team think developments of his brand.

32:46
So those can be little nuggets sometimes that you can feed out there.

32:49
Also, again, when it's new product development and that it's about how where the gaps are, where the opportunities are for people in the marketplace, you know, for different things that can be quite crowded sometimes those little nuggets, again, going back to that tight example that I can't tell you because I'm sort of confidentiality, but there was some stuff that came out of that around, sort of what they offered, you know, that there was opportunities in the market compared to other competitors in that same sort of space that weren't offering anything, you know, that people were frustrated that I just wish someone did this and actually it was a real sort of eye opening moment, jesus actually can do this and it would make a real difference, you know?

33:37
so those sort of things really help it kind of sounds like there are things that, surprising or contradictory.

33:47
Yeah, I think, yeah, like say quite often it's sort of things that other people haven't thought of or things sometimes that actually can be quite clearly obvious, but no one's seen them because they get sort of camouflaged by all the other stuff around them.

34:04
So it's almost like being able to pull away the trees and everything can see that sort of one like that one little thing that standing there that don't ever say it's been all along, but we just haven't seen it, you know?

34:14
that that can be helpful, interesting.

34:23
helpful.

34:23
I don't be rude, sorry, my son is not going to go and pick him up.

34:29
But yeah, I know that it's been extremely helpful.

34:31
I really appreciate that.

34:33
And, yeah, you know, if there's, if there's anyone else you think it might be worth this speaking to you have any other thoughts like, you know, I think, yeah, as I say, we're like kind of the stage where, there's like a team of six verse product engineers, etcetera.

34:49
Like we're just ready to like sink our teeth into a problem.

34:51
Someone has, we just want to build a product that like, you know, that solves the whole research one is interesting because it's something that I guess we've sort of had to some extent, like speaking to various ones of our users when we were creating our original products, I think and it's you know, I think there's something quite it's it's a good fit as well for like the state of the technology is coming to as well with a lot of these like NLP tools and like abilities of like you know search and various things to you know, to do that.

35:17
And so I think yeah like we're just very eager as I say, to like build something useful, you solve the problem, you're doing the right thing, you know, keep keep casting the net wide.

35:30
But like I said, yeah, yeah, places like the I C.

35:33
G.

35:33
And that you'll get a, you know, quite heavy china, people would be interested in voicing opinions on this sort of stuff.

35:41
I'm sure you'll find that helpful.

35:42
Yeah, Simon's okay.

35:45
Like maybe maybe in, I don't know if you think something might speak to a few more people would be really interesting as well.

35:49
Just get your view on, I guess some of the things that we find obviously happy to like cover your time etcetera, appreciate your professional.

35:56
You've got you've got hours and you know what to do etcetera and so like, I don't know with that, you might be interested in that in the future.

36:01
Yeah, sure I'm more than happy.

36:03
Perfect, awesome.

36:04
Alright, well brilliant, thank you so much for that and I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through all of it, really appreciates it, You're welcome and good luck thank you so much.

36:18
Mhm.
