# Kelsey Fernandez

Kelsey Fernandez: Just other research other topics, even just stuff for emails, I, you know, I often find things, papers and articles and things and getting the summaries saves me a lot of time. So because a lot of times, you just have to read the whole thing. Just, I just needed the gist of it. So I'm using it that way. What I'm not using it for is probably one of the things it's designed for, which is like, once, once things are there to be able to relate them to other research projects as well. I'm a user of room research, okay. And I like bringing all of my notes into there because of the way it relates notes. So I'm still trying to figure I know, I can export from Genie. So I've done that a little bit, taking some of my notes from Genie that have been summarised, bring them into Roam. And yeah, so I mean, so that's basically it. I'm not doing my writing in Geni, either. Okay. Even though I know there's a nice facility for it. I'm, I'm taking notes, doing some summarising and gathering thoughts gathering ideas. Okay, okay. So I'm, I'm not using it to its fullest. I realised, but that's what I need it for. So now that we have other tools in place,

Jack Bowen: yeah, that's fine. That's fine. And something that we hear from from a few people. So that makes sense. So just to just to correct me if I'm wrong, but just to clarify, so it's primarily for summarization, not for your full time job, but this side side work. And just, you know, as you said, gathering ideas, pulling ideas out of documents, taking some notes, but then those notes you explore and take to, to Roam, primarily. So right, yeah.

Kelsey Fernandez: I mean, that's the plan. I've not done it a lot yet. But um, yeah, I think that's the workflow I'm seeing happening. Because if I have so much already in Roam, that's already interconnected, just based on Hello, are you there? Yeah, I'm

Jack Bowen: still here. Oh, okay. Yeah,

Kelsey Fernandez: you froze. I have so much already in Roam, from all of my, all of my other sources, feed into Roam, my Kindle notes, my pocket notes, pocket highlights, and all these things are interconnected, just links that I find. I can bring those in as well. So by bringing these in, the nice thing about Roam is it makes things easily discoverable even when you didn't realise there was a link there. And so that's why I like bringing these in, but I don't need the whole article. The summaries are, I think, served me better. You know, and also also just to get get it to rewrite stuff a little bit give me ideas on just how to use the content without plagiarising it. Oh, I use it a little bit that way as well.

Jack Bowen: Okay, okay. And I'm just I'm understanding correctly when you say Kindle notes and pocket notes come into Roam. Is that a direct integration are those do you copy and copy and paste and export things?

Kelsey Fernandez: It's it's a direct integration I go through another tool called Read wise

Jack Bowen: okay. And read wise enables you to just connect your notes to Yeah,

Kelsey Fernandez: read was read wise can import from my Kindle notes. It imports from my pocket notes it imports from there's a whole bunch of sources it can there's even even podcasts you can import your notes from. If you use air pot, I think it's called Air pod. And then, and then you can export to different sources. And I've chosen room that's the only one I'm exporting to. But you can go to there's a lot of things that links to so read wise act sort of as a hub. Okay, sure. Yeah, it's automated. It's automatic. Right, right.

Jack Bowen: So the good thing about writing my guess is that it's just your knowledge base that everything gets funnelled into a lot of a lot of it getting funnelled in that automatically.

Kelsey Fernandez: Do you Yeah, and isn't it? Well, it's not just that it's there. The good thing about Roman This is certainly something you could manage as well in some fashion is it's the backlinks so the the links are two directional and what happens is when you're researching something from your notes in Roam, it will give you related links like things that it thinks are related that you haven't made a direct relationship to yet and choose to include that says that it creates just like, yeah, is where it's worth taking a look at. Just understand what I mean. It's a pretty cool tool.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, no, I've we know, I know Roam, but I haven't used it extensively. I didn't know that it had that suggested linking function. That's super Interesting.

Kelsey Fernandez: That's one of the strongest points and reasons for using a. And, you know, what ends up happening is you, you realise you have things in there that are relevant that you would have missed otherwise, that you've already taken notes on, you know, or that you haven't taken notes on just you have other other sources that are in there for from whatever context and you're able to make relations that you wouldn't have made it as easily or possibly at all, otherwise.

Jack Bowen: Sure, sure.

Kelsey Fernandez: So that's why I like working in Roam.

Jack Bowen: I mean, that makes a lot of sense. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then so it seems like Roam are very is quite a critical tool in your workflow. This is a bit a bit more of a difficult question, I guess, or, I mean, maybe it's hard to answer, but how critical would you say genius in your workflow? Or in other words, like, what would be the impact if God didn't exist? How would you feel if it if you could no longer use it?

Kelsey Fernandez: Well, I'm getting really used to it. I like the summaries are. I mean, who wants to read, nobody ever wants to read a whole paper? Yeah, the things I'm summarising are not just blog articles, but you know, the scientific papers, and it's pulling out enough relevant stuff where I know where I need to read more. And it just saves a tonne of time. So it's not like 100% critical to me yet, but I can see it becoming that way. Because yeah, what I find myself doing now is when I find an article, I don't read it right away, I just save it until I can put it into Genie. Okay. So like, so it's starting to go, go ahead.

Jack Bowen: I was gonna say that I remember, I was gonna say, I was gonna ask, what percentage of articles go through Jeanne and your workflow? And what percentage roughly, do you just not actually, I'd rather just read through the whole thing.

Kelsey Fernandez: So probably all of them at this point, but it's not that many because like I said, I sort of, I mean, different modes at different times. And I haven't been in the research and writing mode recently. But I'm starting to again, okay, I have a number of topics that are kind of started in Geni. And now it's time to follow through on them. Like, I'm looking at LA right now, I'm looking down at my project list. And I'm seeing like, for those that I definitely need to like, fill out

Jack Bowen: soon. Okay. Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. And so when you are interested in I know, you said, you're not in that research and writing mode. Does that mean it just mean you're focusing more on your, your your other job? Or is it is it that there's a different part of this whole process that goes on somewhere else?

Kelsey Fernandez: Yeah, I just with a full time job, I have limited time available. So I have to work, I have to choose what I'm working on. I mean, I would like to work on all things regularly at all times, but it's just not a reality. So right now, I'm working on an online assessment, and automating the scoring and creating an email sequence for the results and that sort of thing. So that's, that's my time right now. You know, so for example, but what but the next thing I'm going to work on is this ebook, which I've already started, but it will definitely Genie will be a big part of that. I already know the topic, I already know most of what it's going to say. But when it gets to the details of writing it, I'll be summarising a bunch of things and organising them in Geni organising my thoughts that way, and, and then taking the notes that I've made and exporting those to Roam, where I don't do my writing either, but using that as my basis to do the writing,

Jack Bowen: right. Yeah. Okay. Sure. That makes sense. Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. So what what type of, I mean, I know you, you've outlined your use case, really clearly there. So thank you for that. And what what sort of person do you think would benefit from using Genie? You know, if you had to describe like, our ideal user, and you're in your mind, who would that person be?

Kelsey Fernandez: I mean, obviously, someone who does a lot of research, reads a lot of papers. I see the summary and the summarising is, to me one of the strongest things

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Okay, that makes that makes a lot of sense. That makes a lot of sense. Okay, and then, I guess moving on to moving on to the new platform. The 1.0 How have you, you know, just starting off generally, what's the experience been like? How have you have you found it so far?

Kelsey Fernandez: I haven't found it so far. I haven't even looked at it yet. I just sort of been Jeanne before we got on the call and saw your little thing about switching over. So I didn't know when you made the switch.

Jack Bowen: To be fair, it was only it was only like less than a week ago. Yeah.

Kelsey Fernandez: Yeah, cuz I was on about a week ago and brought some papers in and I didn't see that so I haven't I haven't seen it. Okay, I can do it right now if you want happened right here. I'm not sure how do I how do I do it?

Jack Bowen: You'd have to go to app.ge.io or if you go to our website and go to login, you'd be able to do it like that

Kelsey Fernandez: may have logged in now. Is there someplace while I'm logged in now?

Jack Bowen: Do want to share your screen

Kelsey Fernandez: yes

Jack Bowen: so let me see if I can if you log out of your current Genie account and go back to the website and click login you'll be able to Yeah,

Kelsey Fernandez: yeah, she takes like mess with all this stuff now. Okay, where's my log out Log Out All right, and then sign in it just signed in it didn't do anything.

Jack Bowen: If you if you go to the if you go to the log out of your account and then go to the genie websites a genie to IO

Kelsey Fernandez: okay. Okay,

Jack Bowen: and then if you click login, it should take you through to the new

Kelsey Fernandez: Okay. page see? Take me to the new app, there we go. Search for my account and then create a linked account.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, yep. So once you do that, it will just connect your subscription together so that, you know, if you've already paid for something, it will just carry forward into the new platform where just just so you know, all of your documents in the old Genie will be migrated across to the new one. But that will be coming in the next week or so. So we're kind of in this in between age where you can create new files and documents in the new platform, and there'll be saved, but it's maybe a week or two. It'll be a week or two, until stuff starts to come through. Maybe maybe, okay, closer to two or three.

Kelsey Fernandez: All right, so brought me back to a U T. H, that genie.io. And it says, still says beta on the login thing, am I in the right place? After I after I did the link account?

Jack Bowen: So after you've done what happens, let me

Kelsey Fernandez: go back. It brought me to the same login that I've had before. I'm going to come back to the your website and try to log in, see what happens again. Now it's asking me to create a linked account again? Yep. So it shouldn't do that. Again.

Jack Bowen: Why I don't know if you've created a new account yet or not. So try to go through the Linked Account again, to just enter your email where it says, Alright, so let's create a linked account. Yeah. And then yeah, and

Kelsey Fernandez: after say, create a linked account, it comes up with that author jeannie.io lat slash login. And the login still says Genie beta at the top. Is that

Jack Bowen: correct? Yeah, that's correct.

Kelsey Fernandez: Okay, that was that was what I was. Sorry. Sorry. All right. cannot link account without active subscription. Okay. Are you

Jack Bowen: UnLtd? Yes. Okay. That will be that will be. I'll be coming in a couple of days, actually. Oh, yeah. So the LCS will come through in a day or two, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a different migration process.

Kelsey Fernandez: Yeah, I understand. Okay, if you want to share your screen and show me anything that would be?

Jack Bowen: Well, I think mainly, it's, maybe be useful to jump in another feedback call once you've, once you've had a little bit of a play around, and we can we can discuss some other things. The Sure thing, if that's all right, yeah, the only other question I was gonna ask was just was just about if you remember how you heard about Genie.

Kelsey Fernandez: Yeah, what was it says mantra, I think is where this was through.

Jack Bowen: Okay, awesome. So I mean, if it's alright with you, I might just try to schedule a follow up for after you've had a bit of time to play around with. The next one won't be too long, maybe 1015 minutes, and we can just run through anything that you find no problem. I'll

Kelsey Fernandez: be happy to.

Jack Bowen: Awesome. Awesome. All right. I think that's everything. Was there anything that you wanted to ask me whilst whilst whilst I'm here regarding the platform, or anything that's come up?

Kelsey Fernandez: I have one nagging question, which I can easily just handle through support. So don't you feel

Jack Bowen: I mean, I'm here now and I'm happy to cover it.

Kelsey Fernandez: Is there is there a way to change my email address associated with the account? Because I don't really, your account is the only reason I'm still holding on to that one. Okay, I used it to sign up. It's not many email address.

Jack Bowen: It's not it's not easy for us to do at the moment. Basically. I can look into I need to speak to the technical team. I know you've had a few requests like this. And it's it's Yeah, we don't have like a quick fix for it. Basically.

Kelsey Fernandez: I understand that. Yeah. It was supposed to be a vanity URL. I wasn't going to use it for email and stuff. But you know, in the hurry of the moment, I just used it and now I'm stuck. Yeah, I don't really need it as a vanity URL. It didn't work out. I'd like to just like cancel that hold. Geez.

Jack Bowen: How about how about I'll speak to the guys and then on the next call. I can I can I can see if I can let you know basically what what the outcome is. And if they do have a solution, we can work through it then.

Kelsey Fernandez: That'd be great. I mean, it's is not the most urgent thing but it would be nice, cool. But as far as the platform Yeah, I look forward to seeing the new the new version.

Jack Bowen: Awesome. Okay, amazing. Thank you so much for your time. It's really great speaking to you, and yeah, maybe in a in a week or two
