# Juan Kimo

Jack Bowen: Good. Nice. Great to meet you. I'm Jack, one of the founders of GE.

Juan Kimo: I am Juan Kimo, one of your users.

Juan Kimo: 

Jack Bowen: Cool. Awesome. Well, thanks for thanks for jumping on the school and taking the time to really appreciate it. No problem. Yeah. So I guess Yeah, the reason for the call really is just, we've released a new version like 1.0. And I'm just trying to gather some feedback, both conceptual on like the last product and, and also more sort of specific on the new one and kind of understand like, yeah, how we build this sort of next part of our robot, really. So I guess like off the bat, it'd be really interesting, just kind of hear a bit more about you and like, what your job is, or what you're what you're studying, or both, if you're if you're, you know, what you're sort of area of interest is and domain.

Juan Kimo: Sure. So, I work for a company called systems oncology, okay. And we have a spin out company, also called polygon Incorporated. Basically, we're in the drug development space for oncology. So I'm oncology, cancer researcher. I started out doing laboratory bench work, Cell Biology, molecular biology, and throughout the years, kind of took on more bioinformatics and informatic type work. So I kind of work at the nexus of both of those spaces. Currently, I also handle some of the IT infrastructure for our company. And some, any kind of solutions needed to advance products as far as a dramatically a handle and coordinate that also. So that's kind of like my general rules. But um, as far as using Genie. It's mainly in researching certain particular topics in biology, cancer research. Additionally, there's some business intelligence work that I do also. So if there's a certain company that has a similar product or like that I'll do research behind that and kind of give a dossier of kind of a competing landscape and issues along those lines.

Jack Bowen: Okay, interesting. Okay, and how long have you been in the field? Like, what have you been doing this quite a while?

Juan Kimo: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I got my PhD around 2000. So yeah, I'd been in the field for a while. Wow, you got to be quite an expert. That's amazing. Yeah. You know, it's, it's just like any other field or job? Yeah. Yeah. The informatics type work kind of took off 2007 2006 and then build up from there.

Jack Bowen: Got it. Okay, interesting. And how did you hear about Genie? Like, what was your journey to sort of finding us?

Juan Kimo: You know, I can't recall. It could have been a YouTube video that I saw or came across. There might have been? Yeah, I don't know how I found you. To tell you the truth. Probably YouTube video, you know, kind of looking into this space of kind of NLP, AI, academic workflows, things like that.

Jack Bowen: Where you do recall, like, trying to solve a we're trying to solve a particular problem, or like, was there an objective you had in mind? When you when you want to come across as I guess?

Juan Kimo: Yeah. So the one thing is a quick summarization of papers and articles. Yeah, that was the main driver. And then also, you know, some of the capabilities to do summarizations Any kind of writing assistance, so you know, how to paraphrasing issues like that have been kind of a interesting opportunity for me.

Jack Bowen: Okay, interesting. And do you remember what it was like? I guess the sort of first time you used it, or like maybe a really early sort of time you use it like what was your sort of what you were doing and like what what problem is you're trying to solve perhaps or like, maybe you weren't maybe just curious. I don't know. Like, do a rough rough idea of that. Oh,

Juan Kimo: yeah, it was mainly the summarization feature. That was the initial attraction. I know, one of the use cases that really helped was, you know, when you have keywords, right. And so if I was interested in a particular keyword and a particular paper, that was a nice thing to hit the keyword and then get all the kind of snippets out of that that really facilitates an investigation and the papers.

Jack Bowen: That's the one where you can click on a keyword and it'll show you every word appears. Yeah, yeah. Got it. Is the way that you use it evolved at all? Like, what is it different? How you use it now?

Juan Kimo: Um, I think with the beta release, we've been playing with that, I think, actually, the summarizations. And the question, answer facility has really come to the fore for me, as far as most attractive features,

Jack Bowen: with a search based one where you can type in a

Juan Kimo: gap. Yep. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. Got it.

Jack Bowen: Interesting. And like, what sort of queries do you put in there? Like, what kind of things you asking?

Juan Kimo: So I haven't my use case of bars. You know, I want to do some background on a particular oncology therapeutic. So you know, a curated set of articles, PDFs, and then made a project out of those. And then asking particular questions around, say, toxicity associated with the product. Efficacy associated with the drug questions like that, and going through, you know, the corpus of PDFs that were uploaded.

Jack Bowen: Okay. And if you find something interesting, like, what do you do next? Do you use websites?

Juan Kimo: Yeah, so I haven't hammered out the workflow for that yet. But certainly capturing those snippets, summaries. And, you know, I am a large, big obsidian user. So that's kind of like my repository of putting things and going from there. But I also imagine, I would maybe want to dive in further into the article and mark it up. And I use, for example, margin note, to do that gives me kind of a visual board of notes that are highlighted. It's just a highlighting app, there's no AI type features to it. So I'd use that in conjunction with Jamie,

Jack Bowen: have you tried using the highlighting in our tool?

Juan Kimo: Yeah, the thing I like, or that is missing is the kind of the, you get, like a mind map visual of your notes, okay. And you can do a quarter of a visual outline, and the individual cards or notes that you make, you know, you can collapse them down. Also, yeah, I think is kind of that visual that is really appealing. And then, you know, you can have multiple versions of papers open. And I think now with the new tab facility, I might be able to do that I haven't tested it out to where you have the same PDF, but you have one PDF that you can go say like for the references. So if you read in the paper, you see a reference you know, usually with just one PDF you got to click to the you know, the bottom of the page

Jack Bowen: Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'm like yes, suppose next question is like what like, what do you like least about Genie? Like, what what's the what's the Yeah,

Juan Kimo: yeah, sometimes I feel like I can kind of get for lack of a better word kind of lost, maybe. Again, I guess maybe I'm more visual and kind of thinking but if I'm just you know, in pulling certain abstract or certain thoughts into a particular note, I know you can link back out to them. But I think it's maybe just a deficit of my thinking, you know, I kind of lose myself and I have that you know, with obsidian also, you know, we have the backlinks and As you know, sometimes you can open up the graph view and that provides a little bit more navigation, if you will. So that's one of the things I like about the margin node is the card

Jack Bowen: view. I like that sort of visual layout.

Juan Kimo: Yeah, yeah.

Jack Bowen: And when you see you feel lost? Are you like using the notes in Genie, and you take a bunch of them? And that's when you feel lost? Or is it just kind of in general, when you have all of these documents,

Juan Kimo: it's kind of maybe more of the freeform structure of the genie note taking process. You know, you kind of have to build your structure on the fly. So you know, put in your headings where the notes came from, if there was a more maybe, you know, to take the sections of the paper and have that pre populated and like you had the summaries? Yeah. Could you just, yeah, like, kind of, it's kind of like, staring at the blank page. And then if you're working on multiple documents, and, you know, if you just had the notes, and then you want to take those notes out, you know, there's some lift to organise them and to take them outside of gene.

Jack Bowen: Right, so it's kind of Yeah, okay. So it's sort of like, structuring things in the notes is, is annoying. And then organising them there, and then sort of taking them out to your obsidian knowledge base is kind of a problem for you.

Juan Kimo: Yeah, it's, it's, you know, it's not a easy lift, it's more of a, you know, there is inertia to get that, get that up and going.

Jack Bowen: When you say like the lift and inertia, is that like to kind of getting out of the platform?

Juan Kimo: Actually, no, just getting the structure into the notes. Okay. Do you know,

Jack Bowen: do you have that problem with obsidian as well?

Juan Kimo: It depends. It depends where the notes are coming from.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Okay. What do you like most about Gd?

Juan Kimo: Like the summarization, the AI paraphrasing. I like the keyword. Quick, easy, click a key word and see the snippets come up. Again, that really facilitates for some reason for me. And then also the working on the corpus of papers. So you're just not asking, say the questions, just one PDF, but you're asking it against the whole corpus of PDFs, which, to my knowledge, maybe there's only one other tool that I'm aware of that can do something similar?

Jack Bowen: Which ones that's illicit? Yeah, of course. Yeah. That's it.

Juan Kimo: It's more of, you know, to, you know, clinical trial type papers.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Have you ever recommended genie to a friend or anyone else?

Juan Kimo: I'm not really. You know, I'm kind of kind of cloistered into my own little, our company is pretty small. So I'm like, the only one that really does this type of work.

Jack Bowen: And like how would you, how would you, how would you describe it from the perspective of like, I don't know, like, like, Well, yeah, I guess, how would you describe your product in terms of like, it sort of problem that it solves really

Juan Kimo: speeds up your research, summarises papers for you, provides, you know, some what's the word? You know, it can do some lifting for writing, right. So well facilitate drafting of research product.

Jack Bowen: When you say lifting, I'm still I'm still kind of, for I kind of understand the like.

Juan Kimo: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, lifting makes it easier to get to that outcome. So if you have 20 papers, going through and reading 20 papers, it's much easier to go through and do a summarization of each paper, or to ask specific questions without actually reading those papers.

Jack Bowen: Right? It's like a retrieval. Yeah.

Juan Kimo: Yeah, yeah. So for the kind of first thing that I did with the beta was, you know, I use research rabbit to find a good tranche of papers describing that particular therapeutic. And then transfer that over to Zotero. Get PDFs through Zotero. And then I took the PDFs from Zotero into Genie, and then I can start asking questions without even opening up papers.

Jack Bowen: Interesting. Okay. I'm

Juan Kimo: sorry, my helper.

Jack Bowen: Very nice. Um, what? What's the sort of typical trigger PTSD, like do you will meet, so you kind of crack it open that they've written?

Juan Kimo: Yeah. And so it was perfect timing for that project on that particular therapeutic, you know, I needed to do some work on it. So that was the first thing I thought of, you know, the beta was just released by you guys. And I go, Oh, that's perfect. Additionally, I have to do some diligence on a particular company. So I'll be doing that through that similar workflow.

Jack Bowen: Okay, got it.

Juan Kimo: And then, and then sometimes I do one off, like, you know, not so much PDF research articles, but maybe, you know, blog posts to things like that.

Jack Bowen: Is that like, a sort of separate thing to your main work?

Juan Kimo: Yeah, yeah. It's more, you know, interest in particular thing, so it does, you know, associated with my work, but not always.

Jack Bowen: Okay, got it. And did you? When you paid for Jeannie, was that like a work expense? Or was that

Juan Kimo: your ads to work? Expense? Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Got it. Yeah. And, okay, and like, what tasks? Do you think that Jeanne, that would you say, Jean you'd like least suited to? Is there anything that you tried to use it for that sort of, like worried badly? Oh,

Juan Kimo: that's interesting question. I don't know, if I have a good answer to that,

Jack Bowen: or that way questions?

Juan Kimo: Can be that's good. You know, maybe just a lack of, sort of a visual navigation or visual cards, you know, that's, again, that's something just that really facilitates me but it's when I'm, you know, doing deeper, deeper dives. And I have all this. I like to see how it's connected to knowledge wise.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Got it. So sort of, like connectivity. And then what? Is there anything, there's anything you can think of that would like, Are there any problems that we're not addressing right now with it that like, you know, still sort of annoying to process

Juan Kimo: you know, maybe just the, you know, kind of the pseudo blank state of the notes. Sure, you can, you know, easily drop things into the notes, but, contextualise and then, you know, adding your own personal organisation, you know, that you have to build that up from scratch and it's minor, but it is there. And then, you know, maybe I don't think you have any kind of markdown exports or anything like that. That's also a minor thing. You have the Word document, export. You know, minor things. It's just easy to copy and paste answer when I

Jack Bowen: got it. Okay. Cool. Any questions think I should be asking? No, no. Brilliant. And cool. Do you have any questions for me it's a you will never

Juan Kimo: know If you have any future looking plans or anything, or you need any more additional user input, you know, I'd be happy to share. Yeah,

Jack Bowen: no. Absolutely. I mean, have you had much of a chance to like play around with the new version? Like 1.0? Yeah.

Juan Kimo: Yeah, I've been messing around with it. That's why I did that. You know, that tranche of papers on that particular molecule drug and started asking questions around it. I haven't systematically gone in and start retrieving and organising the outcomes. So yeah, but I've played around with it.

Jack Bowen: Yes. Okay. Yeah. I mean, if you want to, we can, I think it'll be great to kind of, yeah, hear a bit more about ownership. If you have any follow up in a week or a few weeks or something and kind of see, like, if there's anything we could do to sort of improve the experience. Yeah, I'd be really interested to hear input.

Juan Kimo: Yeah, I'd be happy to. And

Jack Bowen: I don't know if there's anyone else in your field as well, who'd be worth like chatting to. Either he does, like, I can sort of buy research or medical stuff or you know that you think we'd be getting benefit from our tool and let's chat to them.

Juan Kimo: Okay, yeah,

Jack Bowen: too. But yeah, I mean, feel free to hit me up if you think of anyone.

Juan Kimo: Okay, yeah, I will also see if I can plug somebody out. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Brilliant. Yeah, no pressure. Awesome. Well, um, Jeff, thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time. This has been super, super helpful. Yeah, I'll feel free to drop me a message. If you have any other feedback or any issues and bugs or whatever, anything I always look at more than happy to help.

Juan Kimo: Okay, yeah, sounds good. And likewise, on your end,

Jack Bowen: study, thank you for your time. Catch you later

Juan Kimo: already. Bye bye.
