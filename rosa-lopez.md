# Rosa Lopez

Rosa Lopez: Okay, now

Jack Bowen: Well, look, yeah, thanks for taking the time to speak with me. As I kind of mentioned, I'm sort of getting feedback on our products. And we've just been doing a few sort of calls and people trying to find out like, what the sort of response has been like to it. And yeah, whether whether it's like really solving a problem for people. So I guess just like off the bat, I'd be really useful if you just kind of tell me a bit about yourself. And kind of like how you found them how you found this in the first place, what you're using?

Rosa Lopez: Will you tried it? I did when I was in Oxford? And, like, I don't remember exactly. So now I was thinking I'm actually working on the TVs. So I have a lot of papers to read and stuff. So I was thinking maybe in the next week, I can use it and like focuses on actually thinking about like possible papers for you. So then I can see because now the only thing that I remember when I was using it, it was like maybe a stupid question, but like, How can I trust? Can I trust it that will provide me actually the details that I need from the paper? So this kind of course, like how can I trust technology? Okay, maybe more days. Okay, so like, because, like, if you read through the paper, you you know what you need from that paper and you like you're sure to find what you need to maybe like just trusting AI and technology. Like it can only provide me what I actually need. That was the only job that I had that point.

Jack Bowen: Got it. Okay. And like and like what? What sort of papers were you putting in there? Like what what exactly were you using it for? Was it like summarising academic?

Rosa Lopez: Yeah, it was all like, yeah, it was like academic paper, the formula we had to read for research and stuff. And it was mainly to summarise and to read through it.

Jack Bowen: Okay. And do you like how much of a problem is this for you? Like, when was like, when was the last time? Like, how often do you have to read academic papers? Like basically, okay. All right. And he's still reading them every day, every like, every weekday, like when was the last time you read one?

Rosa Lopez: Yesterday and like, I wasted the whole afternoon on like four papers.

Jack Bowen: I think I'm also just quite interested like conceptually in like the problem in you know, without without our tool, there's like a solution, just like what it's ready to do. Yeah,

Rosa Lopez: the idea that you can save time is actually the, the best thing. Because, as I said, I wasted my whole afternoon yesterday.

Jack Bowen: And I'm like, what you ever tried looking for, like solutions to this before? Like, have you ever tried to find anything else to help with it? No. And why is that?

Rosa Lopez: Because we just used to do it, and we have to do it. So we do it.

Jack Bowen: Okay. All right. Do you have you ever use somebody else's notes or like ask for help from somebody to to go through a paper like 400 You know what I mean? Like if you ever you ever, like use somebody else's summary or something, like you

Rosa Lopez: know, like, man, let's stop that I have to do so.

Jack Bowen: And it's not because like, you don't think that somebody else will have read this paper? Like it's so sort of specific or is it because you know,

Rosa Lopez: I think it's the same like I would not trust another person as well as I don't trust technology, right. So like, I think If I do it by myself, I can actually find what I need. Maybe I think that's

Jack Bowen: okay. That made sense. Do you? Like, what if it was like someone who didn't translate what it was like a professor or someone that like summarised it, like, would that be acceptable?

Rosa Lopez: Like, would I use the summary that they made? Yeah. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Yeah. Got it. Have you ever recommended it to anyone? Yeah. Okay, interesting. And what did you how did it like come up in conversation? Like, what was the sort of context

Rosa Lopez: around this week? Because we were talking about TVs or papers to read, and a lot of stuff to do. Yeah. So like, I think what time saving thing is, is the key point.

Jack Bowen: And like, What tool do you use the moment to kind of take all of your notes like, where do you where do you keep everything? Again, What tool do you use the moment to kind of keep all of your notes and papers and everything organised?

Rosa Lopez: Oh, I'm using my iPad. Okay. So okay, I have all the papers. Which up? It's a mess. It's good notes. Though. Got it? Do you have the opportunity? Or is this?

Jack Bowen: No, it's something that comes up quite a lot, actually. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. A lot of people have asked about an app. I think for us, it's like, we're trying to, I guess we're trying to make the website work as well as possible before we like increase the surface area that we have to develop on. Because if you start building an app, it gets very complicated quite quickly. Like,

Rosa Lopez: I was thinking also, when I use my iPad, like, a lot of people ask me which app is this? Because it's really important. Maybe if you're going that direction

Jack Bowen: okay. And, like, how much of a problem like how many of your friends also complained about? I guess, like having not having enough time while they're having to read things?

Rosa Lopez: Like it's pretty common, pretty common.

Jack Bowen: Like most of them, or half of them or it's like, like, most of them are half of them or

Rosa Lopez: Yeah, yeah, I would say most of them as well off the car. I don't know if it's my problem.

Jack Bowen: Oh, sorry. I can turn mine off as well. Is that better?

Rosa Lopez: Yeah, I was saying yeah, I think most of them

Jack Bowen: Okay, got it. Um, all right, and all the questions so like I noticed that you didn't convert from the trial what was the main reason why that why you didn't want to like pay for it basically.

Rosa Lopez: I guess like for students in general like you always try not to pay service for free. Yeah, just go for the free one. Then I check it like it's not too expensive, but then you always like that. Yeah, but I can also do it without I don't need to pay these and then maybe I will not use it. Yeah. Stuff like that.

Jack Bowen: How did you end up paying for good notes because good notes is not it's not free? Is it?

Rosa Lopez: Oh, no, my sister paid for that. And I used to be honest. Yeah, actually, like, for example, good lord and using it every day so that you realise it's actually you really need that. So I think if you realise you really need like, or do you need actually really saving my time then I would do that and I think it's all about like trusting that it's actually working it takes time the like qualities it's actually gives me what I need, then I would pay for that.

Jack Bowen: Got it. Do you think that like okay, so it kind of sounds like it sounds it sounds like the you almost didn't like

Rosa Lopez: Or like, you know what I was thinking, because then I check the website again. And so that you have like the premium price. Yeah. And it says like, there's 7% More of AI accuracy or something like that. Yeah. It also goes back to my like, the first question like, How can I trust it? Like if, for example, I pay less, but then it's not that accurate?

Jack Bowen: Oh, I see. That's okay.

Rosa Lopez: That's what I thought yesterday when I open it.

Jack Bowen: Okay, that makes sense. Okay. And like,

Rosa Lopez: I was thinking now, like, my sister, I was focused, she had good notes before. And I saw that it was actually like we tool and be useful. And that's what also like other people are seeing when I use it, and then they bought it as well. Yeah, so maybe, like, if you actually see people using that? Yeah. That's another thing. Yeah, sure that it works. And it saves time is

Jack Bowen: no, I think you're right. I think that's interesting. Okay, um, got it. Do you think are there any questions I should ask you.

Rosa Lopez: Let's do like this. I'll try to use it in the next days and see if I have other ideas. Okay, do you want to know something specific? You're looking for specific answers.

Jack Bowen: It's just kind of in and around really, like, we're just trying to understand like the, how we can improve it. So like, we retain some users, like some people continue using it. But we see a lot of users dropping off after like, the first month or two,

Rosa Lopez: retail. Yeah, exactly. You know, after paying as well.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. All pay once, for instance, and then and then leaving. So like, we're just trying to understand like, because, like, the value proposition of what it offers is clearly attractive to people, like people do want to save time. And so we're trying to understand, like, why the end up leaving, like, whether it's because the solution isn't good enough? Or because

Rosa Lopez: what about what about like, like, food? Not something, you know, you pay once and then you have that? Yeah. What about something like that? So you have one year,

Jack Bowen: or we do annual, we do annual subscriptions as well. I think we just kind of see like, what we tend to see there. Is that like, sort of similar, similar drop off of free trial, like, but we find the I don't know. Yeah, it's, it's slightly better, I think, but it's still kind of, it's like, it's a lot to ask people to pay upfront for something if they don't, if they don't know it super well. And like they did if it works. It's kind of the it's kind of what I'm hearing.

Rosa Lopez: Because I think if I have to pay every month, then I will think about it. If you just pay once and you know that you have the service that will be maybe an easier to see.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, that's true. Hmm, interesting. Okay. No, yeah, no, please do I, I can. I can add another I can add a few more days of trial to your account as well. So you can

Rosa Lopez: No, it's fine. It's fine. It's already like two weeks. It's okay.

Jack Bowen: Well, yeah, and like, you know, take it for a spin and see what you think I'd be. Yeah, be great. Be great to like, follow up, perhaps like a few days, maybe? Sure. Do you want to call again? Like maybe next Friday?

Rosa Lopez: Yeah. And of next week? Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Cool. All right. I'll start that off. We'll send you a calendar invite. And I'd love to just get your feedback really on like, just ask the question, like, is this like useful or not? And like, you know, if it's not like what, what's the what's the core issue? This they have we make it better? Okay.

Rosa Lopez: Okay. Then the hell?

Jack Bowen: They want to? Awesome. Roberto, thank you so much for speaking with me. I really appreciate it. Oh. Yeah, honestly, a bit of a nightmare trying to get feedback from people. There's this kind of paradox. It's a paradox and working on like a productivity tool, which is that like, the people you try and talk to you don't have very much time and so they don't have time to talk to you. Yeah, I really appreciate it. No,

Rosa Lopez: okay. Let me that I'm currently scheduled for next

Jack Bowen: Friday. Awesome. Perfect. Oh, shoot. You link them again. Yeah, looking forward to Okay. Thanks. Bye bye.
