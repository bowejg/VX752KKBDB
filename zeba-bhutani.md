# Zeba Bhuntani

Jack Bowen: come speak with me. Of course. Awesome. All right, let's get to it. So as a quick intro, I'm Jack, I'm one of the founders of genie and reduce loss of two years really. And purpose is just to kind of find out a bit more about you your research process problems you have how you're finding the platform, that kind of thing. All right, perfect. Awesome. So first question curious about. Yeah. Tell me a bit about yourself. Like, what are you using Genie for? What are you studying? What's your job? Yeah. What was the kind of backstory? Yeah.

Zeba Bhutani: I am a PhD student in nursing and neuroscience.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. And are you like, okay, so you're doing PhD? And like, well, you have your PhD you? And,

Zeba Bhutani: um, so my first year? Okay, got

Jack Bowen: it. Awesome. Whereabouts?

Zeba Bhutani: Cleveland, Ohio.

Jack Bowen: Nice. Nice. I've never been. All I know is there's a big Amazon data centre in Ohio. And that's about it.

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, so there's not that much else out. Michelle. So you would have breached, Linda? It's okay. It's all right. It's cheap. So that's the nice part

Jack Bowen: that is good for students? And what are you using Genie? For you like reading papers? Taking notes? What what sort of

Zeba Bhutani: oh, so one of my classes right now is a basically everything that has to do so there microbiology class. And we are required to read like three papers a week. So Genei really helping me with just kind of get more summaries on them. So don't need to know all the details of the paper. It's just a general idea. Okay,

Jack Bowen: and how did you find us? Did you like, were you like looking for a solution or design recommended? Or what was the kind of? Yeah,

Zeba Bhutani: I didn't even know that this was even a technology that was available until I saw I think it was some of the PhD students that I know. They mentioned it, I think was like on an Instagram video or something like that. They Okay. Mentioned that Cheney was around.

Jack Bowen: And were they like, influences? They like people who kind of do promotional content? Or was it just kind of just like a?

Zeba Bhutani: I think it was promotional, but I'm not 100%? Sure.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Got it. And have you recommended it to anyone?

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, I've recommended to a couple of friends. I looked into a bunch of other similar programmes and stuff, but I think Genie, these fit my needs the best. And it was the most well organised and actually had answers to my questions and stuff while other companies either charged way too much or, you know, weren't accessible. Okay. Which other ones did you look at? Oh, I'm trying to remember the names now. I can't quite remember. Sorry. From the top of my head. I think scholarly? Was one of them gonna see it? Hmm. And then there was a couple other ones, but all of them either charge too much, or they were just too complicated. Okay. I have enough complicated stuff in my life. To be complicated.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Okay, got it. And. Okay. And like, how long have you been using it for?

Zeba Bhutani: I think my trials that only ended a couple days, so only a couple weeks.

Jack Bowen: All right. And how would you feel if you could no longer use it?

Zeba Bhutani: I'm pretty bummed. All right. Pretty. That's why I was emailing frantically that like my subscription wasn't working anymore. Okay.

Jack Bowen: And what sort of, so do you feel like it's solving a problem for you right now, like, well, what's the kind of? So you mentioned that you weren't even sure it was really thing? And then some other PhDs showed it to you? Like, how did that kind of like come up? Like, what was the sort of context around that?

Zeba Bhutani: Well, we had a bunch of papers that were scheduled to be read. And so they were like, hey, instead of reading through all of these, and then going down the rabbit holes, of what each thing means. Here's a cool programme that just summarises everything for you. Okay.

Jack Bowen: And that was something that kind of resonated with you.

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, especially since I'm still newer to research. And I have a background in nursing, which is a little bit different than neuroscience, it really helps to have especially like things to find really quickly. And you don't have to search the entire paper and glossary and then supplementals to understand what they're saying.

Jack Bowen: Okay, how come you don't feel like you have to search it? Do you just kind of using the summaries or the search features or

Zeba Bhutani: both of them as I have been enjoying getting some of the search features as well because if you just put it into Google then you have both Google or Google Scholar? And then it seemed to me like 15 papers instead of just answering the one question that you had

Jack Bowen: got it, okay. Okay, interesting. And what do you think? What What kind of defines you as like a user of Genie, if that makes sense? Like why, like, this is quite weird question like, how do how would I find more people like you? I guess like, what, what sort of what is the, the the set the set you belong to the means that this is like a useful tool for you, if that makes sense?

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, um, maybe the best category would be like, either PhD or graduate students that are exploring new areas of research or trying to understand more in depth areas they haven't explored yet. Okay. Like, I guess, for example, like the people that I've recommended it to, for either MD students or MD PhD students that maybe are trying to explore new areas of research, that they don't have a lot of background. Okay. If that makes sense?

Jack Bowen: Yeah, that makes sense. And what, um, is there anything we could do to like, I don't know, like, Do you have any? Are there any issues with that tool right now, things that I can annoy you with things we can fix, like only one, the ones that sort of, I've always found quite frustrating is like, not having like a ctrl F on the PDFs, like be able to do like,

Zeba Bhutani: yeah, that's huge. That's pretty huge, actually. And the

Jack Bowen: others like that, so

Zeba Bhutani: it took a second or two to figure out like the best way to upload sometimes into Genie different documents, because so many of them either come as PDFs or PubMed piles, or different things like that.

Jack Bowen: Okay Is it PubMed file is like just like a is that like a reference citation stuff.

Zeba Bhutani: Sometimes, they're just like a URL, which is pretty easy. But then other times, they'll like it use a VPN to get into certain files into PubMed, and then, like syncing PDFs and times where it will send me like a link to the PDF and then I have to like download it and then put it in different different folders on my computer and then upload it to genie to make sense.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. That makes sense. Um, and it's there any other other issues. So like Ctrl F was like, one, getting stuff into the platform. Any other like weird problems, or

Zeba Bhutani: I can't say too much, because there's a few, like four or five days where I couldn't even use the programme. So I was using it probably, like, four or five days total. But I would probably in the future, have more feedback. But at least at this point, there's not much yet because I'm like, I'm still learning the platform.

Jack Bowen: Okay. And do you use the note taking features? Or do you take your notes somewhere else? Like, what's your sort of core knowledge base right now?

Zeba Bhutani: I've been trying to take some notes there as well. But my main two note taking places are either notability or notion. Okay, is notability which I was happy to see that your customer service, like questions are on notion as I guess more people using notion

Jack Bowen: legibility and iPad up.

Zeba Bhutani: It's a I think it's an iOS app now that you can like do it from your laptop PC anywhere? Go to

Jack Bowen: why, what do you do? Do you take do you kind of export stuff down from God and then put them into notability or notion.

Zeba Bhutani: Sometimes I'll put, like, I'll just link things in notion like this is where like, this is the paper that I was reading and and I'll then click the GED link, but for notability it's mostly just handwritten notes that I really liked doing in there. So that I can remember a little bit better.

Jack Bowen: Those bits in notability is like a sort of stylus right on the paper. All right. Okay. Got it makes sense. Um, do you? Like so? Is there anything? So is there anything that I realised I think you just got in, you just got access to 1.0 now, right. Probably a bit early then ultimately. 18 So like, one of the big things you worked on at one point, I was like a note taking. We found that there's like a big pattern of people just exporting stuff. And it gave us like a sort of transient purpose in like people's research. Stack really and so like that that's one thing works on it might might be better to kind of ask about this another time, but I think that makes sense. And like, do you think that they're okay, so do you think there are there any other questions like I should be asking, Do you think there's anything that would be helpful to know if you're like, developing this thing?

Zeba Bhutani: Again, if I was like four to five days into this, I would have more.

Jack Bowen: What about just concern about about the problems that you face doing research? Like, I don't know, is there anything that you'd like helpful to know about why it's particularly difficult as a problem more?

Zeba Bhutani: I mean, this is more of a personal thing. But I second reference managers and citations. I used Mendeley and Zotero. I've used all of them. And I feel like all of that, for some reason have the most difficult UI I've ever encountered.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Got it? Do you? What is what is the main problem that you'd say it solves for you right now? Gee, like, what was the kind of core issue that you that really led you to start using it? Was it? Because I suppose like, yeah, if you were to, like, drill down into it. So you mentioned that you had like a bunch of papers to read and want to do it? Like, why? Why couldn't you just read the papers? I guess? Well,

Zeba Bhutani: the biggest thing is, I really no. I mean, I've been studying nursing for so long. And now moving into neuroscience, I feel like I am so far behind where it should be. And so, you know, I there's a lot of things that I'm still learning on what certain experiments are put certain pathways, and I just feel like, I never have enough time. If I had all the time in the world to just read papers, then I would, but I don't have that kind of time. So this is a way to just kind of speed things up and just progress by learning a lot faster.

Jack Bowen: Okay. So it's like, you feel like you need to catch up, because you've transitioned from one subject to another. And so yeah, you need to like, get through the content a bit faster than everyone else.

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, I mean, I work full time. And I'm a student, like, I just don't have time to just read papers, I need streamline everything as

Jack Bowen: fast as possible. If you're a nurse full time as well.

Zeba Bhutani: I be working with different projects and different pas, okay, for the patients.

Jack Bowen: Got it. It's so interesting, that's actually a weird theme that started to emerge in talking to people, there are loads of folks who use Genie, because they have a job as well as, as well as studying and the, they kind of need to like, get all that reading and do their work and have a social life. And exactly, like another guy, I was chatting to his. He's seen like some sort of master's in education, like a PGCE, or whatever. I don't know if you have that in states, but then he's also a full time teacher, and he was kind of like, just melting down, like with the amount of stuff that you have to get through. So that's quite interesting. Maybe that's something that perhaps like defines your use case a little bit more as well, the fact that you've, you're also like working, and that's an additional constraint and your time. Cool. Okay. D, like, I suppose the question really like, do you? Did you did you? Did you kind of discover the search features? Were they like, did you kind of get on those pretty early on? Are they sort of something that you had to kind of find out later or

Zeba Bhutani: tertiary features? I'm sorry,

Jack Bowen: like being able to like search all your papers?

Zeba Bhutani: Oh, I had to know it for nursing school, we had to look up different papers for like a nursing it's a really big thing to be on top of the research to know like how to care for your patients the best. So I've been pretty familiar with things like PubMed and different journals.

Jack Bowen: And while I mean, just searching within the platform,

Zeba Bhutani: oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm just I always use Ctrl F for everything. And so when it wasn't there,

Jack Bowen: okay. Okay, cool. All right. And last question, like is there anything we can do to make it better?

Zeba Bhutani: Again, I'll have more feedback when I use it for a little bit longer. That's fine.

Jack Bowen: Got it? Awesome. All right.

Zeba Bhutani: Well, do you mind if I ask you a couple questions? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Sorry, far away. Yeah. All right. No, it's okay. So I'm trying to, after my PhD, I'd really like to get into startups. And you know, that kind of side instead of academia. So I'm curious, like, how did you get involved in this? And how did you like, come up with this?

Jack Bowen: Good question. Yeah. Um, so I was doing a master's uni my final year. And I kind of got interested in startups as like a friend of mine. It was like our final year, and there were loads of these, like career fairs and stuff going on. And I think we just kind of, yeah, I didn't know we had this sort of slightly rebellious attitude towards it. And we're like, we don't really want to go and get jobs, we want to maybe do our own thing. And so kind of got involved in that sort of community that way. Not a couple of people who are sort of similarly minded. And then we were trying to find, like an idea or something to work on. I suppose we were like, we were kind of trying to, we're trying to find like, A, we want to do something like NLP, like with machine learning. And then the biggest problem we had at the time was like trying to get to all of our reading. Because we were, you know, messing around with like startup stuff on the side and already doing our research. So we, we sort of discovered our own problem in that sense, and then set out to solve it. And yeah, just kind of bashed away at it from there. It was really tough actually, like, I mean, we did this, we did like a pre seed round off some angel investors, but they were like, it took a lot of work to find them. And like, we had to put so much effort into, like, prove that there was even a tiny bit of interest in this in order to like getting the funding because I think he's like raising money or whatever, like, you need that you got to have like some kind of credentials or whatever. If you don't have them, then you need to show like a product with some traction. Now, often, we did that we like, spent the precede horribly, got really low on funds, and then go into Y Combinator. Luckily, off the back of the traction we had, and then, yeah, I ended up raising like a venture round in October last year. That's pretty cool. That's the kind of TLDR any No, no, it's

Zeba Bhutani: very interesting.

Jack Bowen: Any, what do you think you're going into? Like? What's your sort of area of interest?

Zeba Bhutani: At this point, I didn't even know it was really an option until a couple months ago to a maybe a year, one of my friends is really interested in startups. He's part of one right now. And then again, to go back and get his PhD. So I've just been kind of taking notes on how he deals with, you know, VCs companies, and raising and all that kind of stuff. But I have no idea what I would even be a part of. So I don't have any inventions yet of my own or any products that I would even want to or services even.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, I'd say my biggest bit of advice, really, and this is something that I think we were just very lucky. Like, we got quite lucky, which I think allowed us to make mistakes that didn't kill us. Like otherwise. You know, I think like we probably would have folded a long time ago. But I would take a look at Paul Graham has some really good essays on this stuff. And then also, he gets quite political, but there's some earliest stuff is all mostly about like startups. And then the other thing I'd recommend as well as this book has like a PDF of it. Or here's a summary that actually I think it's got the original somewhere. These are like probably the two things I really wish I'd discovered earlier. Like, I think I think the thing people get wrong about startups is they think that like the solution is the clever thing. But I think the smartest part about a company is like identifying a problem that people haven't solved properly yet. That's something I really wish I knew, like earlier on, because I think it would have saved us so that like we iterated around different things. And I think if we knew that, if we were less precious about the solutions that we built and less obsessed with these, like code bases, we spent ages building I think we would have been like, more tuned into like, talking to more people and listening to their problems rather than like, thinking of stuff that we think might be useful building it and then trying to make people use it, if that makes sense.

Zeba Bhutani: Okay, and that makes that makes sense.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Yeah, I read you read the I read those recently essays written on test I think you'd be about 10 times further ahead than most entrepreneurs or people who are starting companies. Yeah.

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, I guess the hardest part is just finding people that are interested in the same thing as

Jack Bowen: true as well. I think you got to go deep on stuff and like live amongst people. I think you're probably in a very lucky position in that like, I've never actually had like a like real corporate job. I did a few internships but then I went straight student company and like, I think the disadvantage that brings is that like Like, you don't actually have that much you don't have that much exposure to like real life problems, I think we've been okay. Because like, we ended up solving one for like researchers, and we were researchers once but like, you know, if you worked as a nurse, for instance, like, I'm sure you're like, extremely, you're, you're, you're an expert in the problems that they face. And so you would be a very well suited person to like, you know, identify when those problems and solve it with like a, you know, a company or a tool or whatever. So, I think, yeah, going deep on stuff and like, having like a very, like experiential, like, in depth knowledge of a field is extremely useful and like, be able to solve its problems. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if that's helpful.

Zeba Bhutani: No, it really, is it really everyone that I talked to, they're always like, Oh, just go into academia.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, it's not. It's weird. Yeah. I mean, that's also another option. I don't know, it depends what you want, I guess. You got to Yeah, also pick something that you're actually passionate about, like, I've met people who, like I know, a guy who went through YC as well. And he, he's like a really good programmer. And he joined this other person startup. And it was like a company working on like a sort of DTC, like skincare, routine app or whatever. So you could like, enter some details and join this community. And it was sort of like sending like skincare products. And, you know, like, they raised a bunch of money in Alaska and went through yc. And the guy just ended up quitting later, because he was like, you know, I spoke to him, he was just like, he just didn't care. Like, yeah, he just wasn't interested in it. And like, it doesn't really matter, like how much like Kashi raise or how much you're like you pay to do it or whatever. Like, when you're in this sort of, I guess when you're when it's just when it's just you or like you and a very small team, like you've like, you know, it's it's got to be about something that you you feel passionate about, I think and that will like power you through all of the times when like, it's not going well or whatever. So, yeah, definitely pick something you care about. Rather than something that like, looks like it'd be a good idea that.

Zeba Bhutani: And then so the last question, sorry, that I have for you.

Jack Bowen: Honestly, very, I'm more than happy to answer a tonne of questions on this, because I think I like really wish someone had told me a lot of things when I was when I was like starting out.

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, well, if you're willing to meet again, in the future, when I have more feedback on the product, and then I have more questions for you. I'd be very open to that. Yeah. But it's someone that's very beginner in coding and trying to teach myself. Yeah, I've been using a programme called Code Academy to teach myself, I don't know, if you had any other recommendations.

Jack Bowen: Um, that one's actually pretty good. I, I kind of learned to code off like a bunch of YouTube videos when I was at school. And then like, like high school, I think you call it not like uni. And then I ended up learning react through Code Academy, which is what we ended up building our first product. And I think it's pretty good. I think. Yeah, I think I think Code Academy is very, very good for that. I'm trying to think the, when you when you if you do end up building, like a tech solution, or whatever it is, like, I think learning how to MVP something properly is like really useful as well. Just like, really distilling the core value of what it is that you're actually offering. Because like, like I say, like, the the problems, the problem is the clever part, not the solution. And that's really what you're trying to validate. And so like, you know, one of the things I wish we spent less time doing was like, building really huge developed apps that, you know, took, you know, weeks and weeks or whatever to, to kind of put together like, I think with a very, you know, like, they I think I think, you know, it's it's pretty powerful idea, you know, anyone can like build software these days. And I think I think if you just kind of like really early on, like figure out how to build the most minimum product you'll like you'll be able to move through, iterate through more ideas faster, and you'll probably find something that works earlier. And you'll like, you know, you'll raise more money, you'll be on better terms, you'll get there faster. Everything like you know, growth growth solves most of your problems and like you'll get to growth faster, if that makes sense.

Zeba Bhutani: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. Any anything else? Anything else you curious about? Or you got other questions? Like yeah, more than happy to

Zeba Bhutani: right now, I don't have any questions, but hopefully next time we meet I will.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, no problem. Yeah, and if you think of anything, drop me a message. I'm more than happy to help out I can send you more like recommendations as well for other things to like read or videos to watch or whatever. Like I say, it's just like, I think you can save yourself like you can save yourself like months of time by like reading doing doing like proper due diligence and like reading the right things for you. Like get into it if that makes sense.

Zeba Bhutani: No, yeah. So feel free to send whatever my way that you can think of

Jack Bowen: sure all right yeah nice and reach out if you have any other questions all right thank you so much nice chat See you later
