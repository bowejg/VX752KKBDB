# Jennifer Interview

Jennifer:  Abe. Take one, mark (00:00:00:10 - 00:00:03:09)

Jennifer:  for school. (00:00:07:07 - 00:00:11:14)

Jennifer:  So we just a little bit about your education and your mentor, (00:00:12:15 - 00:00:15:23)

Jennifer:  but I'm curious if you can describe your earliest experiences (00:00:15:23 - 00:00:20:21)

Jennifer:  on a job site (00:00:21:12 - 00:00:23:15)

Jennifer:  where your first exposure to construction? (00:00:24:18 - 00:00:28:22)

Jennifer:  I don't know. Let me see. (00:00:29:08 - 00:00:32:10)

Jennifer:  My earliest experiences (00:00:32:10 - 00:00:34:22)

Jennifer:  on a job site were primarily in Atlanta, (00:00:34:22 - 00:00:39:11)

Jennifer:  and we were doing a lot of housing authority jobs and so that consist (00:00:39:11 - 00:00:45:02)

Jennifer:  of abatement, interior demolition (00:00:45:02 - 00:00:48:04)

Jennifer:  as well as full structural demolition of (00:00:48:04 - 00:00:50:15)

Jennifer:  housing and projects such as Thomasville Heights, Inglewood. (00:00:51:18 - 00:00:56:06)

Jennifer:  So we're talking 3 to 400 apartments. (00:00:56:07 - 00:00:59:16)

Jennifer:  Also Winter Brook Apartments, that's (00:01:00:09 - 00:01:03:22)

Jennifer:  part of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport (00:01:04:22 - 00:01:07:17)

Jennifer:  and so a lot of those projects were similar in size and scope. (00:01:07:17 - 00:01:11:22)

Jennifer:  And those were really my early introductions (00:01:12:02 - 00:01:15:06)

Jennifer:  to the construction world as far as being actually on site. (00:01:15:06 - 00:01:19:04)

Jennifer:  Well, did it open your eyes to. (00:01:19:21 - 00:01:21:07)

Jennifer:  Just the logistics of it all. (00:01:23:00 - 00:01:25:01)

Jennifer:  There's always this thing when it comes to construction (00:01:26:01 - 00:01:29:11)

Jennifer:  about the field versus the office. (00:01:29:11 - 00:01:32:12)

Jennifer:  And I think that no one is greater than the other. (00:01:32:22 - 00:01:37:09)

Jennifer:  But we have to admit that the field actually gets the work done. (00:01:37:09 - 00:01:41:00)

Jennifer:  However, in order to get there, you definitely need (00:01:41:11 - 00:01:44:16)

Jennifer:  the office's support to even have the paperwork. (00:01:44:20 - 00:01:47:21)

Jennifer:  Right? Have the job books. Right. (00:01:47:21 - 00:01:50:03)

Jennifer:  Have everything in order so that you can secure your position (00:01:50:10 - 00:01:54:09)

Jennifer:  and start on site. (00:01:54:09 - 00:01:56:18)

Jennifer:  What was it about logistics that led to this logistics? (00:01:57:10 - 00:02:00:18)

Jennifer:  Because you're talking about having all the employees in the right spot. (00:02:00:18 - 00:02:04:22)

Jennifer:  Are they working in the correct areas of how are you going to tackle (00:02:04:22 - 00:02:08:23)

Jennifer:  getting the job done? (00:02:08:23 - 00:02:11:04)

Jennifer:  Luckily we have Troy, who is our VP and he's very good (00:02:11:04 - 00:02:15:15)

Jennifer:  at creating the vision of where the project will go. (00:02:15:15 - 00:02:20:08)

Jennifer:  Egress digress. (00:02:21:05 - 00:02:22:12)

Jennifer:  Things like that in so how it will flow because you don't want to use (00:02:22:12 - 00:02:26:12)

Jennifer:  too much materials or you don't want to not be able (00:02:26:12 - 00:02:29:13)

Jennifer:  to get the excavator or the bobcat on site in the correct area. (00:02:29:13 - 00:02:33:22)

Jennifer:  You want to be able to create (00:02:34:05 - 00:02:36:06)

Jennifer:  a secure containment that can sometimes (00:02:37:01 - 00:02:39:19)

Jennifer:  include the dumpster as well as a bobcat, depending (00:02:39:19 - 00:02:43:15)

Jennifer:  on the type of work or scope or how it's located. (00:02:43:15 - 00:02:47:06)

Jennifer:  So having all that logistically planned, but also as a demo (00:02:47:14 - 00:02:52:16)

Jennifer:  and environmental contractor, it's important to have the trucks on time. (00:02:52:16 - 00:02:57:00)

Jennifer:  So you want to make sure that they are in sync. (00:02:57:07 - 00:02:59:20)

Jennifer:  You have good operators, but you want to make sure that they are (00:02:59:23 - 00:03:02:21)

Jennifer:  in sync with the hauling so that you're not slowed down or delayed. (00:03:02:21 - 00:03:07:01)

Jennifer:  You also want to ensure that you have the correct (00:03:07:20 - 00:03:11:12)

Jennifer:  amount of materials and supplies to get the work done. (00:03:11:12 - 00:03:15:13)

Jennifer:  There's nothing worse than at 12:00. (00:03:15:21 - 00:03:18:00)

Jennifer:  The office gets a phone call that you've ran out of supplies. (00:03:18:00 - 00:03:21:01)

Jennifer:  And generally for us, our supplies are not local. (00:03:21:01 - 00:03:24:08)

Jennifer:  So we would have to call that in. (00:03:24:08 - 00:03:26:05)

Jennifer:  So that could be a one or two delay if that were to happen. (00:03:26:05 - 00:03:29:03)

Jennifer:  And all of this needs to be done in the field, but it also needs (00:03:29:13 - 00:03:32:22)

Jennifer:  to be translated to the office so that they can provide the support (00:03:32:22 - 00:03:36:19)

Jennifer:  that the field needs to get the job done on time and in time. (00:03:36:19 - 00:03:41:03)

Jennifer:  So why do you think you're uniquely good at that? (00:03:41:21 - 00:03:44:18)

Jennifer:  I'm uniquely good at that because I've spent time in both sectors. (00:03:45:12 - 00:03:49:09)

Jennifer:  I like to say that I've done a lot of the jobs. (00:03:49:17 - 00:03:51:20)

Jennifer:  Usually when someone has done (00:03:52:04 - 00:03:53:08)

Jennifer:  construction work, they've kind of been limited to one scope. (00:03:53:08 - 00:03:56:09)

Jennifer:  When I started out, I was an administrative assistant. (00:03:56:16 - 00:03:59:17)

Jennifer:  I was making minimum wage and I was able to work my way up (00:04:00:07 - 00:04:05:12)

Jennifer:  because I had a mentor that supported my goals and my visions of wanting to grow (00:04:05:12 - 00:04:10:20)

Jennifer:  and wanting to know about everything that I could get my hands on. (00:04:10:20 - 00:04:14:18)

Jennifer:  And so from there, I was able to do estimating, (00:04:15:00 - 00:04:18:15)

Jennifer:  which I still do for the company as well. (00:04:18:15 - 00:04:20:15)

Jennifer:  I was able to do a superintendent (00:04:20:21 - 00:04:23:15)

Jennifer:  and work with them and channel them and see exactly what they do. (00:04:23:15 - 00:04:26:18)

Jennifer:  I was able to become a project manager (00:04:27:01 - 00:04:29:15)

Jennifer:  and ultimately before I started Elemis, I was the vice president (00:04:29:22 - 00:04:33:23)

Jennifer:  of environmental services for the company that I was working for, (00:04:34:06 - 00:04:37:12)

Jennifer:  and that really provided the leadership role of understanding what goes on, (00:04:37:19 - 00:04:42:02)

Jennifer:  just not with the daily aspects, but strategy for the business overall. (00:04:42:02 - 00:04:46:16)

Jennifer:  That little bit about your journey into (00:04:48:02 - 00:04:51:10)

Jennifer:  the engineering (00:04:53:08 - 00:04:54:14)

Jennifer:  at the engineering side of your career? (00:04:55:07 - 00:04:57:12)

Jennifer:  Mm hmm. (00:04:57:14 - 00:04:58:01)

Jennifer:  Were you naturally gifted at math? (00:04:58:22 - 00:05:00:12)

Jennifer:  This is something that you just kind of realized was inherent. No. (00:05:00:12 - 00:05:03:19)

Jennifer:  It. Growing up in high school, I hated math. (00:05:04:03 - 00:05:06:23)

Jennifer:  And so I actually based my major on something that was not math related. (00:05:07:01 - 00:05:12:15)

Jennifer:  So I thought and so that's why I went. (00:05:12:15 - 00:05:15:10)

Jennifer:  When I started off in college, I looked at the curriculum and I said, (00:05:15:10 - 00:05:19:13)

Jennifer:  okay, let me make sure there's the least amount of math (00:05:19:13 - 00:05:22:12)

Jennifer:  as possible in psychology. (00:05:22:21 - 00:05:25:20)

Jennifer:  But I was wrong (00:05:25:20 - 00:05:27:06)

Jennifer:  because I got into my fourth year and statistics killed all of my dreams. (00:05:27:06 - 00:05:31:06)

Jennifer:  And so that's why I'm not a therapist today. (00:05:31:06 - 00:05:33:10)

Jennifer:  So if not for anything, what I learned to do (00:05:34:14 - 00:05:39:17)

Jennifer:  when it came to construction math was kind of go back to the basics. (00:05:39:17 - 00:05:43:22)

Jennifer:  A lot of construction. Math is algebra based. (00:05:44:04 - 00:05:46:21)

Jennifer:  And so understanding that component in learning (00:05:46:21 - 00:05:51:03)

Jennifer:  how to read blueprints and plans and how that tied into specifications. (00:05:51:03 - 00:05:56:17)

Jennifer:  So the way that I was able to become (00:05:57:02 - 00:06:00:10)

Jennifer:  good at it was that I was able to make it relatable. (00:06:00:10 - 00:06:03:19)

Jennifer:  A lot of times when you're doing math in school, it's (00:06:04:02 - 00:06:04:03)

Jennifer:  A lot of times when you're doing math in school, it's (00:06:04:03 - 00:06:06:20)

Jennifer:  just when you become get to high school or college, (00:06:06:20 - 00:06:10:14)

Jennifer:  they don't really give you those fun examples that they do when you're a kid. (00:06:10:20 - 00:06:13:16)

Jennifer:  Like if you have seven kids and three kids and you're minus one, (00:06:13:16 - 00:06:16:21)

Jennifer:  it's not like that. (00:06:16:21 - 00:06:18:00)

Jennifer:  It's just hear the numbers. Here's the shape. (00:06:18:00 - 00:06:20:08)

Jennifer:  Figure it out. (00:06:20:13 - 00:06:21:20)

Jennifer:  And so with construction, I was able to correlate things (00:06:21:20 - 00:06:26:11)

Jennifer:  that actually made sense, like how many halls of dumpsters or if you (00:06:26:11 - 00:06:31:10)

Jennifer:  have this amount of concrete or driveway or you have this amount of doors. (00:06:31:10 - 00:06:36:01)

Jennifer:  So I was able to make sense of it like that by using (00:06:36:09 - 00:06:39:12)

Jennifer:  real life examples of what actually made sense. (00:06:39:12 - 00:06:43:12)

Jennifer:  Once you realize that, (00:06:44:14 - 00:06:45:11)

Jennifer:  is that what sort of propelled you into becoming the youngest. (00:06:45:11 - 00:06:48:16)

Jennifer:  The pastor? (00:06:49:08 - 00:06:50:09)

Jennifer:  Yeah. (00:06:50:09 - 00:06:50:20)

Jennifer:  When what really propelled me to get (00:06:50:20 - 00:06:54:10)

Jennifer:  my general engineering license in California was (00:06:54:10 - 00:06:58:04)

Jennifer:  I saw the way that things were done and how employees acted. (00:06:58:04 - 00:07:02:05)

Jennifer:  If they didn't get their way or temper tantrum or they break up or you didn't (00:07:02:18 - 00:07:06:20)

Jennifer:  give them the bonus or the title or the amount of pay that they wanted. (00:07:06:20 - 00:07:11:18)

Jennifer:  And I said when I started Elemis, there's no way in the hell I'm (00:07:12:02 - 00:07:15:01)

Jennifer:  going to let anyone hold me over a barrel. (00:07:15:12 - 00:07:17:21)

Jennifer:  If anything, I'm going to be the qualifier. (00:07:18:02 - 00:07:20:16)

Jennifer:  And I wanted to make sure that, as with any business owner, (00:07:21:00 - 00:07:25:07)

Jennifer:  if you own a business but you don't even know how to do it or what (00:07:25:13 - 00:07:25:14)

Jennifer:  if you own a business but you don't even know how to do it or what (00:07:25:14 - 00:07:30:02)

Jennifer:  it entails, so how can you instruct someone or direct someone to do the work? (00:07:30:02 - 00:07:35:03)

Jennifer:  The good thing about me is that any job that I'm (00:07:35:10 - 00:07:39:00)

Jennifer:  giving someone or any of my employees, for the most part, (00:07:39:00 - 00:07:42:14)

Jennifer:  I have done it with the exception of being an asbestos supervisor. (00:07:42:18 - 00:07:43:22)

Jennifer:  I have done it with the exception of being an asbestos supervisor. (00:07:43:22 - 00:07:47:00)

Jennifer:  So I know what goes into the job. (00:07:47:15 - 00:07:50:00)

Jennifer:  I know how long it's going to take. (00:07:50:00 - 00:07:51:18)

Jennifer:  I know what's required. (00:07:51:18 - 00:07:53:13)

Jennifer:  And being a black woman, it was absolutely imperative (00:07:53:13 - 00:07:57:12)

Jennifer:  that I was the qualifier because I didn't want anyone (00:07:57:12 - 00:08:00:20)

Jennifer:  to have the doubt that I was incapable (00:08:00:20 - 00:08:04:00)

Jennifer:  or to do like a lot of (00:08:04:06 - 00:08:07:01)

Jennifer:  women have done. (00:08:08:09 - 00:08:09:14)

Jennifer:  We've seen this a lot when it came to doing certifications, (00:08:09:14 - 00:08:12:15)

Jennifer:  and that was when you had a white woman in the position, but it was actually (00:08:12:15 - 00:08:17:08)

Jennifer:  her husband who owned the company and she would be the front person. (00:08:17:08 - 00:08:21:08)

Jennifer:  And but you couldn't ask for anything technical because basically (00:08:21:08 - 00:08:25:05)

Jennifer:  it was her husband's business and she was just the front person. (00:08:25:10 - 00:08:28:14)

Jennifer:  I never wanted people to have that impression about me, (00:08:28:23 - 00:08:31:21)

Jennifer:  so I wanted to make sure that they knew that I was capable of (00:08:32:03 - 00:08:35:17)

Jennifer:  doing the work, that I understood the technical terms and the nuances (00:08:35:17 - 00:08:40:05)

Jennifer:  that were involved in doing a general engineering project. (00:08:40:05 - 00:08:44:10)

Jennifer:  She sees her piece (00:08:45:20 - 00:08:47:18)

Jennifer:  behind the curtain and saw a kind of who was still really in charge. (00:08:47:18 - 00:08:51:00)

Jennifer:  Yeah. Yeah. (00:08:51:05 - 00:08:52:11)

Jennifer:  And also, too, I never I never wanted an employee or someone else (00:08:52:11 - 00:08:53:22)

Jennifer:  And also, too, I never I never wanted an employee or someone else (00:08:53:22 - 00:08:56:00)

Jennifer:  to pick up and go, because sometimes your dreams are not another person's dreams. (00:08:56:00 - 00:09:00:06)

Jennifer:  So if I if I gave you the keys to my vehicle that I would be stranded. (00:09:00:15 - 00:09:04:12)

Jennifer:  Did you always know (00:09:05:12 - 00:09:06:11)

Jennifer:  that you wanted to run your own business? (00:09:06:11 - 00:09:09:12)

Jennifer:  I have spent a lot of time owning my own business. (00:09:09:12 - 00:09:14:12)

Jennifer:  Now they weren't successful, but I was 18, 19. (00:09:14:16 - 00:09:18:20)

Jennifer:  But I always wanted to do something that had no ceiling. (00:09:18:20 - 00:09:23:18)

Jennifer:  And so it was great to be able to get a job in construction (00:09:24:02 - 00:09:29:08)

Jennifer:  and work for someone who was so supportive because there wasn't a ceiling. (00:09:29:08 - 00:09:34:03)

Jennifer:  There. (00:09:34:08 - 00:09:34:17)

Jennifer:  I could have still been an administrative assistant to this day, but I wanted more. (00:09:34:17 - 00:09:40:00)

Jennifer:  And so I think ownership is important, but (00:09:40:00 - 00:09:43:03)

Jennifer:  you really have to have that desire and love what you do. (00:09:43:03 - 00:09:46:06)

Jennifer:  And I absolutely love what I do. (00:09:46:06 - 00:09:48:20)

Jennifer:  Against all the challenges that you face. (00:09:48:20 - 00:09:51:11)

Jennifer:  You know, a lot of times people ask, like, if you talk about all these bad things (00:09:52:12 - 00:09:55:04)

Jennifer:  You know, a lot of times people ask, like, if you talk about all these bad things (00:09:55:04 - 00:09:57:09)

Jennifer:  that have happened to you in construction, why do you still do it? (00:09:57:09 - 00:10:01:04)

Jennifer:  And I tell them that no matter who I work for or where I go, (00:10:01:05 - 00:10:06:06)

Jennifer:  I'm still going to be black and I'm still going to be a woman. (00:10:06:16 - 00:10:09:17)

Jennifer:  So if I'm going to be black (00:10:10:00 - 00:10:11:21)

Jennifer:  and a woman, I'd like to be a black woman who enjoys what she does. (00:10:11:21 - 00:10:15:11)

Jennifer:  Whether I go work for a software company or hospitality or retail or whatever (00:10:15:18 - 00:10:21:22)

Jennifer:  it is, I'm still going to encounter racism. (00:10:21:22 - 00:10:25:05)

Jennifer:  I'm still going to encounter sexism. (00:10:25:17 - 00:10:28:08)

Jennifer:  And so it's a matter of to what degree do (00:10:28:14 - 00:10:31:19)

Jennifer:  you want to deal with it no matter where I go, I'm going to encounter both. (00:10:31:19 - 00:10:34:22)

Jennifer:  So at least I'm doing something (00:10:34:22 - 00:10:37:00)

Jennifer:  in this space where I want to be and I make the decision to be there. (00:10:37:00 - 00:10:40:15)

Jennifer:  To what degree is such a hard thing (00:10:41:04 - 00:10:44:14)

Jennifer:  to ask yourself, you know, because you've you've overcome so many challenges. (00:10:44:14 - 00:10:49:05)

Jennifer:  But as we talked about, you're (00:10:49:05 - 00:10:50:17)

Jennifer:  constantly. (00:10:52:00 - 00:10:53:04)

Jennifer:  Oh, yeah, definitely. (00:10:53:04 - 00:10:54:05)

Jennifer:  There is no overcoming racism or sexism. (00:10:54:05 - 00:10:58:01)

Jennifer:  It's it's prevalent. (00:10:58:13 - 00:11:00:01)

Jennifer:  It's not about where you're geographically placed. (00:11:00:01 - 00:11:03:08)

Jennifer:  I've worked in 13 states and I've encountered racism and sexism (00:11:03:15 - 00:11:07:17)

Jennifer:  from coast to coast, from the East Coast to the West Coast, down south Midwest. (00:11:08:08 - 00:11:12:16)

Jennifer:  It doesn't matter. (00:11:12:16 - 00:11:13:16)

Jennifer:  It doesn't matter. (00:11:13:16 - 00:11:13:21)

Jennifer:  The thing about it is that you have to learn to work (00:11:13:21 - 00:11:17:18)

Jennifer:  in spite of the obstacles and what people don't realize (00:11:17:18 - 00:11:22:10)

Jennifer:  is that when you're on the receiving end, you are already prepared to receive it. (00:11:22:10 - 00:11:26:06)

Jennifer:  So when you are already prepared to receive it, it's more (00:11:26:06 - 00:11:29:11)

Jennifer:  shocking to the other person than it is to you. (00:11:29:11 - 00:11:32:06)

Jennifer:  I'm more shocked when I don't have to deal with racism and sexism than I am (00:11:32:12 - 00:11:37:00)

Jennifer:  when I encountered it, because it's just par for the course. (00:11:37:04 - 00:11:41:18)

Jennifer:  But I love what you've done to kind of like take training into your own hands (00:11:41:22 - 00:11:45:12)

Jennifer:  and sort of like create a community in which (00:11:45:19 - 00:11:47:18)

Jennifer:  hopefully, you know, (00:11:49:17 - 00:11:50:16)

Jennifer:  over time we can come at that as a representative, (00:11:50:16 - 00:11:54:15)

Jennifer:  diverse community in construction. (00:11:55:19 - 00:11:57:15)

Jennifer:  Well, at this point, we're kind of at an impasse. (00:11:57:15 - 00:12:00:08)

Jennifer:  Before, there was a lot of talk about diversity (00:12:01:03 - 00:12:04:11)

Jennifer:  and inclusion, and those were kind of like buzzwords (00:12:04:17 - 00:12:08:03)

Jennifer:  that we'd hear throughout the construction industry today, (00:12:08:03 - 00:12:12:07)

Jennifer:  especially following after the George Floyd incidents. (00:12:12:07 - 00:12:15:15)

Jennifer:  Companies have now been put on alert that you can't use those buzzwords (00:12:16:01 - 00:12:20:10)

Jennifer:  without actually putting the action behind it. (00:12:20:10 - 00:12:23:08)

Jennifer:  So you can't tell me that you care about Black Lives Matter (00:12:23:16 - 00:12:27:06)

Jennifer:  or that you care about LGBT, TCU, and you don't have any black people (00:12:27:10 - 00:12:31:17)

Jennifer:  at your company, or there are no black people on your website or in the C-suite, (00:12:32:05 - 00:12:36:07)

Jennifer:  or there are no women or there are no LGBT CU representatives (00:12:36:07 - 00:12:40:14)

Jennifer:  or Latinas or Asian or Indian. And (00:12:41:10 - 00:12:45:01)

Jennifer:  I can't believe it. (00:12:46:01 - 00:12:47:10)

Jennifer:  And so now companies have become to get exposed, (00:12:47:10 - 00:12:51:15)

Jennifer:  and now they have to make a decision. (00:12:51:15 - 00:12:53:20)

Jennifer:  Are you going to, you know, practice what you preach (00:12:53:20 - 00:12:57:15)

Jennifer:  and put your money where your mouth is or are you not? (00:12:57:15 - 00:13:00:07)

Jennifer:  And the flip side of that is that because we have a severe labor shortage (00:13:00:15 - 00:13:05:00)

Jennifer:  within the construction industry, you can't really afford to just hire (00:13:05:00 - 00:13:08:21)

Jennifer:  only white men anymore because there are not enough white men (00:13:08:21 - 00:13:11:18)

Jennifer:  in this country to sustain the gap that we have in construction. (00:13:11:18 - 00:13:15:06)

Jennifer:  So it's not a two different conversations anymore of let's do diversity, (00:13:15:13 - 00:13:20:00)

Jennifer:  let's do inclusion. (00:13:20:00 - 00:13:21:02)

Jennifer:  No, you have to have diversity and inclusion. (00:13:21:02 - 00:13:24:00)

Jennifer:  You have to train minorities and women (00:13:24:05 - 00:13:27:02)

Jennifer:  in the industry because you won't have any workers. (00:13:27:02 - 00:13:29:22)

Jennifer:  And so if you don't have any workers, you're not making any money. (00:13:30:03 - 00:13:33:01)

Jennifer:  And if you're not making any money, then you're not in business. (00:13:33:05 - 00:13:35:20)

Jennifer:  And so at what (00:13:37:01 - 00:13:37:12)

Jennifer:  point did you decide to take training at your own hands? (00:13:37:12 - 00:13:39:20)

Jennifer:  We've always taken training into our own hands (00:13:40:16 - 00:13:44:00)

Jennifer:  because we know as a black contractor that black contractors hire (00:13:44:00 - 00:13:50:08)

Jennifer:  black workers, we hire women, we hire Latina workers. (00:13:50:08 - 00:13:55:16)

Jennifer:  And so we know that we know that traditionally white companies, (00:13:55:16 - 00:14:00:06)

Jennifer:  large white companies, they don't hire unskilled or untrained workers. (00:14:00:06 - 00:14:04:11)

Jennifer:  So for us, we see ourselves as a vehicle. (00:14:04:18 - 00:14:07:14)

Jennifer:  So even if you don't stay with the elements, we're (00:14:07:19 - 00:14:10:21)

Jennifer:  willing to bet on you to create the job awareness (00:14:10:21 - 00:14:14:11)

Jennifer:  and create the career opportunities as a stepping stone. (00:14:14:11 - 00:14:18:03)

Jennifer:  And so we have had an insurmountable amount of success (00:14:18:10 - 00:14:22:23)

Jennifer:  when it came to training people, because there is a stigma (00:14:22:23 - 00:14:26:11)

Jennifer:  that people are lazy and they don't want to work. (00:14:26:11 - 00:14:29:01)

Jennifer:  And especially that stigma (00:14:29:06 - 00:14:31:00)

Jennifer:  is very prominent when you're talking about the black and brown communities. (00:14:31:00 - 00:14:34:12)

Jennifer:  What we know to be true is that is not the case. (00:14:34:19 - 00:14:37:19)

Jennifer:  It's not that black and brown people don't want to work. (00:14:37:19 - 00:14:40:16)

Jennifer:  It's that they don't have the same access and opportunity to do the work. (00:14:40:17 - 00:14:45:01)

Jennifer:  At L.A., we provide the access and opportunity (00:14:45:08 - 00:14:48:05)

Jennifer:  for people who look like me to enhance their careers. (00:14:48:10 - 00:14:52:07)

Jennifer:  It's not just about career enhancement, (00:14:52:07 - 00:14:55:11)

Jennifer:  but you have to think about the impact that that has on a person's life. (00:14:55:11 - 00:14:59:02)

Jennifer:  If you're talking about a person, we have a demolition operator (00:14:59:10 - 00:15:03:05)

Jennifer:  who I would put against anybody in this country, (00:15:03:12 - 00:15:07:15)

Jennifer:  and that's how much confidence I have in this guy, John Brown. (00:15:07:15 - 00:15:11:10)

Jennifer:  He's very good, (00:15:11:10 - 00:15:13:01)

Jennifer:  but at the same time, he may not be the most educated person on paper. (00:15:13:01 - 00:15:18:02)

Jennifer:  We have people who are illiterate and literally (00:15:18:12 - 00:15:21:09)

Jennifer:  cannot read anything other than their name and their paycheck. (00:15:21:09 - 00:15:24:03)

Jennifer:  But they are great operators, (00:15:24:12 - 00:15:27:17)

Jennifer:  they're great skilled labor and they are very good at what they do. (00:15:27:17 - 00:15:31:19)

Jennifer:  And so we have to get away from thinking that college is the only answer. (00:15:32:03 - 00:15:36:23)

Jennifer:  College? It leaves you in debt. (00:15:37:14 - 00:15:39:03)

Jennifer:  I went to law school. (00:15:39:03 - 00:15:39:23)

Jennifer:  I'm here to tell you, you know, if you're paying for stellar education, (00:15:39:23 - 00:15:44:16)

Jennifer:  going to Georgia State, going to Arizona State University is not cheap. (00:15:44:16 - 00:15:49:01)

Jennifer:  And so it's not always the answer for everyone. (00:15:49:09 - 00:15:52:13)

Jennifer:  We have a lot of people. (00:15:52:20 - 00:15:54:03)

Jennifer:  Like I said, we have a kid and he's 22 years old. (00:15:54:03 - 00:15:56:22)

Jennifer:  He's been on the machine since he was 14. (00:15:56:22 - 00:15:59:01)

Jennifer:  And he can teach anyone how to operate a skids store or operate an excavator. (00:15:59:08 - 00:16:04:06)

Jennifer:  And that's just passing it on. (00:16:04:06 - 00:16:06:12)

Jennifer:  We have women who had no formal skill (00:16:06:19 - 00:16:09:18)

Jennifer:  training in construction, but we gave them an opportunity. (00:16:09:18 - 00:16:13:04)

Jennifer:  And now they're superintendents, they're making 50, $75,000 a year. (00:16:13:09 - 00:16:18:09)

Jennifer:  All they needed was a chance to showcase that they are willing to work (00:16:18:17 - 00:16:23:16)

Jennifer:  and that they want to work. (00:16:23:19 - 00:16:25:08)

Jennifer:  And hey, we set them free (00:16:25:08 - 00:16:27:15)

Jennifer:  when. (00:16:29:08 - 00:16:30:12)

Jennifer:  Oh, yes, of course. (00:16:30:12 - 00:16:33:12)

Jennifer:  I don't care (00:16:33:12 - 00:16:34:09)

Jennifer:  if the good folks are (00:16:38:13 - 00:16:40:11)

Jennifer:  going. (00:16:41:11 - 00:16:41:22)

Jennifer:  That's nice to do. (00:16:41:22 - 00:16:46:02)

Jennifer:  Hey, guys, don't roll cameras, please. (00:16:46:02 - 00:16:47:17)

Jennifer:  Hey, April sale the piece, though I can't tell how far out I know (00:16:47:17 - 00:16:52:01)

Jennifer:  my shoulder hurts to two times an illusion A lot going on, you know. (00:16:52:19 - 00:16:55:19)

Jennifer:  You tell me when it's right back, (00:16:57:07 - 00:16:59:11)

Jennifer:  all right. (00:17:00:15 - 00:17:01:04)

Jennifer:  It speeds and speeds. Yes. (00:17:01:04 - 00:17:03:07)

Jennifer:  All right. (00:17:03:07 - 00:17:03:15)

Jennifer:  And the mark. (00:17:03:15 - 00:17:07:02)

Jennifer:  You're swerving. (00:17:07:02 - 00:17:08:08)

Jennifer:  And you're like, oh, no, (00:17:08:16 - 00:17:11:00)

Jennifer:  you're definitely (00:17:11:16 - 00:17:13:02)

Jennifer:  that. I (00:17:14:13 - 00:17:15:02)

Jennifer:  guess so. (00:17:17:06 - 00:17:19:04)

Jennifer:  And so. (00:17:19:04 - 00:17:20:02)

Jennifer:  Am I, standing in the right place. (00:17:20:16 - 00:17:24:06)

Jennifer:  So for me or what (00:17:24:06 - 00:17:29:10)

Jennifer:  really (00:17:31:04 - 00:17:31:16)

Jennifer:  distract duty on purpose, right? (00:17:36:03 - 00:17:41:06)

Jennifer:  Oh, yeah, right. (00:17:41:06 - 00:17:42:21)

Jennifer:  This. (00:17:42:21 - 00:18:00:13)

Jennifer:  Okay. (00:18:00:13 - 00:18:04:02)

Jennifer:  Okay. (00:18:04:02 - 00:18:04:11)

Jennifer:  So could you (00:18:04:11 - 00:18:05:20)

Jennifer:  talk a little bit more about how (00:18:06:07 - 00:18:08:13)

Jennifer:  how you're training down skilled workforce? (00:18:08:13 - 00:18:11:06)

Jennifer:  Okay. (00:18:12:02 - 00:18:12:22)

Jennifer:  So our training really started off (00:18:12:22 - 00:18:16:02)

Jennifer:  because we do a lot of housing projects. (00:18:16:02 - 00:18:19:07)

Jennifer:  There is a component that HUD has called section three and basically the residents (00:18:19:18 - 00:18:24:18)

Jennifer:  who reside in the housing projects are considered Section three residents. (00:18:24:18 - 00:18:29:08)

Jennifer:  And so what we discovered in doing the housing project work that we do (00:18:29:19 - 00:18:34:14)

Jennifer:  is that it's very rare for residents to see a black contractor. (00:18:34:14 - 00:18:40:00)

Jennifer:  So we would be bombarded by people coming to the gate wanting to know what we do. (00:18:40:06 - 00:18:46:15)

Jennifer:  How could they get a job? (00:18:46:20 - 00:18:48:02)

Jennifer:  Because it's just a rarity. (00:18:48:02 - 00:18:50:05)

Jennifer:  So what we started to do and what's actually a part of (00:18:50:17 - 00:18:53:16)

Jennifer:  any HUD job that you do, is there is a goal. (00:18:54:01 - 00:18:57:12)

Jennifer:  And now it's kind of turned into a mandate to hire Section three residents. (00:18:57:12 - 00:19:01:21)

Jennifer:  A lot of times people would say, (00:19:02:06 - 00:19:04:04)

Jennifer:  we can't find anyone, they're not eligible, they're all women. (00:19:04:04 - 00:19:07:18)

Jennifer:  And so we said, we'll hire the women. (00:19:07:18 - 00:19:10:00)

Jennifer:  And so we did. (00:19:10:05 - 00:19:11:13)

Jennifer:  And so what we did, we partnered with Atlanta Workforce (00:19:11:13 - 00:19:15:07)

Jennifer:  and they were able to help us basically on board. (00:19:15:07 - 00:19:20:23)

Jennifer:  A lot of the people. (00:19:20:23 - 00:19:21:23)

Jennifer:  That means that they helped us do drug screening, (00:19:21:23 - 00:19:25:23)

Jennifer:  OSHA training, and in some cases, we've been able (00:19:26:06 - 00:19:30:02)

Jennifer:  we've been able to even have them pay for the asbestos abatement certification (00:19:30:05 - 00:19:35:11)

Jennifer:  so that the women and men who we wanted to train became (00:19:35:18 - 00:19:39:19)

Jennifer:  certified as asbestos workers within that state. (00:19:39:19 - 00:19:42:22)

Jennifer:  And so is that really that really worked out. (00:19:43:14 - 00:19:47:02)

Jennifer:  But we wanted to do more. (00:19:47:03 - 00:19:49:14)

Jennifer:  And so we said, what if we kind of upped the ante a little bit (00:19:49:14 - 00:19:52:19)

Jennifer:  and we just kind of opened it up so that we're not just limiting ourselves (00:19:52:19 - 00:19:56:04)

Jennifer:  to residents of local housing projects, but really for anyone. (00:19:56:04 - 00:20:01:03)

Jennifer:  So we kind of got overwhelmed because everyone started (00:20:01:03 - 00:20:04:14)

Jennifer:  appearing out of the woodwork like, Hey, give my son a job. (00:20:05:04 - 00:20:07:23)

Jennifer:  My grandpa, my grandson needs a job. (00:20:07:23 - 00:20:10:00)

Jennifer:  My brother, my sister, you know, my mother, whomever. (00:20:10:00 - 00:20:13:03)

Jennifer:  And so we started to kind of filter through. (00:20:13:12 - 00:20:15:21)

Jennifer:  But it's really worked out because again, we do what we call (00:20:16:06 - 00:20:19:17)

Jennifer:  like the formal classroom training will re provide OSHA ten, OSHA (00:20:20:08 - 00:20:24:05)

Jennifer:  30 has Whopper training, but then we also provide the (00:20:24:05 - 00:20:28:07)

Jennifer:  on the job training, which is when we infuse the trainees (00:20:28:07 - 00:20:32:17)

Jennifer:  with our apprentices, with our skilled labor. (00:20:32:17 - 00:20:37:00)

Jennifer:  And people are a bit squeamish about that idea (00:20:37:05 - 00:20:39:15)

Jennifer:  because they're thinking about their workers comp and things like that. (00:20:39:15 - 00:20:42:20)

Jennifer:  But we kind of do like a slow roll. (00:20:42:20 - 00:20:44:20)

Jennifer:  We kind of we kind of figure out what they're good at, what they're capable (00:20:45:02 - 00:20:49:12)

Jennifer:  of, and really place them where they need to be. (00:20:49:12 - 00:20:53:07)

Jennifer:  And our our hiring is great and the firing is even better (00:20:53:18 - 00:20:58:03)

Jennifer:  because we don't really have to (00:20:58:03 - 00:20:59:03)

Jennifer:  fire anybody because if it's too much, they just quit. (00:20:59:03 - 00:21:01:16)

Jennifer:  They spend a couple of days on the job and they're like, This is so much work. (00:21:02:08 - 00:21:06:00)

Jennifer:  No, thank you. (00:21:06:07 - 00:21:07:12)

Jennifer:  And so we've been able to have like an 81% (00:21:07:12 - 00:21:10:12)

Jennifer:  success rate and retention rate when that goes on. (00:21:10:12 - 00:21:13:16)

Jennifer:  But we also have relationships with other contractors. (00:21:13:17 - 00:21:16:20)

Jennifer:  And so they know that we do good work. (00:21:17:03 - 00:21:20:00)

Jennifer:  And so let's say that we're not working in that area. (00:21:20:00 - 00:21:23:08)

Jennifer:  There's nothing going on. (00:21:23:13 - 00:21:25:04)

Jennifer:  It's it hasn't been a problem for them to take that certification (00:21:25:04 - 00:21:28:21)

Jennifer:  and go work elsewhere, because, again, (00:21:29:01 - 00:21:31:04)

Jennifer:  the contractors struggle is I don't want to train the people. (00:21:31:04 - 00:21:34:16)

Jennifer:  I don't have the time. (00:21:34:20 - 00:21:36:04)

Jennifer:  I don't want the risk or the liability. (00:21:36:04 - 00:21:38:05)

Jennifer:  Well, we've done that. (00:21:38:05 - 00:21:39:03)

Jennifer:  And so that unskilled, untrained person (00:21:39:03 - 00:21:42:21)

Jennifer:  now is a skilled labor worker who can now go work at another company (00:21:42:21 - 00:21:47:17)

Jennifer:  or our competitor or somewhere larger or even out of the state. (00:21:47:23 - 00:21:51:22)

Jennifer:  And that's really been (00:21:51:22 - 00:21:53:03)

Jennifer:  a successful venture that we've done and it's worked very well. (00:21:53:03 - 00:21:56:20)

Jennifer:  What does a what does a double typical day inside of that training look like? (00:21:57:10 - 00:22:01:20)

Jennifer:  A typical day, it depends. (00:22:02:09 - 00:22:04:11)

Jennifer:  Well, first we start off with the classroom training. (00:22:04:11 - 00:22:07:11)

Jennifer:  So you're going to need to do the classroom training for OSHA. (00:22:07:11 - 00:22:10:05)

Jennifer:  But then if you're an asbestos worker, you're going to need to do the five day (00:22:10:11 - 00:22:14:03)

Jennifer:  course to become a certified asbestos worker. (00:22:14:03 - 00:22:16:23)

Jennifer:  But then you can legally perform (00:22:17:16 - 00:22:20:03)

Jennifer:  asbestos work if you're a demolition contractor. (00:22:20:08 - 00:22:23:08)

Jennifer:  What we've done is we kind of pair them with people. (00:22:23:08 - 00:22:27:07)

Jennifer:  And so when there's off time or downtime, (00:22:27:07 - 00:22:29:18)

Jennifer:  we'll have one of the skilled excavator operators (00:22:30:00 - 00:22:32:21)

Jennifer:  really start to help the person who has a propensity to know how to do it. (00:22:33:12 - 00:22:38:14)

Jennifer:  A lot of people are just you'd be surprised or kind of like (00:22:38:19 - 00:22:42:07)

Jennifer:  kind of like an overnight success thing. (00:22:43:08 - 00:22:44:23)

Jennifer:  They like you. (00:22:44:23 - 00:22:45:18)

Jennifer:  They can get it on the machine (00:22:45:18 - 00:22:47:15)

Jennifer:  and really be able to listen to the direction and really help. (00:22:47:15 - 00:22:51:12)

Jennifer:  And so we'll have them move little things around the job site, (00:22:51:12 - 00:22:55:03)

Jennifer:  off the job site and do hauling and putting things in the dumpsters. (00:22:55:09 - 00:22:59:08)

Jennifer:  But it's kind of a 3 to 4 months of, (00:22:59:14 - 00:23:02:12)

Jennifer:  you know, of training that they're able to receive. (00:23:02:16 - 00:23:05:08)

Jennifer:  And if they're good at it, you know, they keep going. (00:23:05:14 - 00:23:08:06)

Jennifer:  In the classroom is is right where these people live. (00:23:09:06 - 00:23:13:01)

Jennifer:  Yeah the classroom (00:23:13:19 - 00:23:15:09)

Jennifer:  we would generally and we've actually done it on site (00:23:15:09 - 00:23:18:12)

Jennifer:  at some housing projects they have like community or rec centers (00:23:18:12 - 00:23:21:19)

Jennifer:  because a lot of the people don't have transportation. (00:23:21:19 - 00:23:24:15)

Jennifer:  If we did do something, we've done shuttles where we shuttle, (00:23:24:23 - 00:23:28:07)

Jennifer:  the people in or we've even picked a place that has access to public transportation (00:23:28:07 - 00:23:33:17)

Jennifer:  and we make sure they get there and and get home safely. (00:23:34:01 - 00:23:38:00)

Jennifer:  So what's been the most rewarding (00:23:38:20 - 00:23:41:00)

Jennifer:  aspect of training, educating, mentoring for you? (00:23:41:00 - 00:23:43:16)

Jennifer:  The most rewarding thing is seeing that you're able to change lives. (00:23:43:19 - 00:23:48:23)

Jennifer:  For a lot of people who are privileged, a job is just a job. (00:23:49:14 - 00:23:53:08)

Jennifer:  They can quit and pick up another one and go find workplace. (00:23:53:08 - 00:23:57:02)

Jennifer:  But for someone who may not have the formal education (00:23:57:02 - 00:24:00:07)

Jennifer:  or the financial means, having a job that is not just a job (00:24:00:07 - 00:24:05:16)

Jennifer:  but a actual career or is something that is life changing. (00:24:05:16 - 00:24:09:20)

Jennifer:  It improves their self esteem. (00:24:10:02 - 00:24:12:11)

Jennifer:  It provides opportunities for them to move out of the housing projects. (00:24:12:11 - 00:24:16:07)

Jennifer:  It provides is a valuable skill set that they can take anywhere in the country (00:24:16:14 - 00:24:21:10)

Jennifer:  and do the work. So you're not limited. (00:24:21:10 - 00:24:23:16)

Jennifer:  You're giving them a job that will never be outsourced again. (00:24:23:16 - 00:24:28:01)

Jennifer:  It doesn't matter how advanced construction gets, (00:24:28:07 - 00:24:31:02)

Jennifer:  someone's got to get on that machine and ensure that the work is done properly. (00:24:31:10 - 00:24:36:07)

Jennifer:  Someone's got to be able to remediate the hazardous materials from a building. (00:24:36:10 - 00:24:41:11)

Jennifer:  And so that's rewarding in itself. (00:24:41:18 - 00:24:43:19)

Jennifer:  Seeing people make the lifestyle change, they're able to purchase a car, (00:24:43:19 - 00:24:48:02)

Jennifer:  they're able to move into a better neighborhood, (00:24:48:07 - 00:24:51:02)

Jennifer:  they're able to get out of the one or two bedroom apartment (00:24:51:02 - 00:24:54:11)

Jennifer:  and maybe rent three bedroom apartment or purchase a house. (00:24:54:15 - 00:24:57:21)

Jennifer:  And so those are the things that matter. (00:24:58:03 - 00:25:00:03)

Jennifer:  And also to we're able to see growth. (00:25:00:03 - 00:25:03:10)

Jennifer:  You know, black businesses hire black people. (00:25:03:20 - 00:25:07:04)

Jennifer:  And when we hire someone who looks like us, (00:25:07:04 - 00:25:10:09)

Jennifer:  we are showing them that if I can do it, you can do it. (00:25:10:09 - 00:25:14:12)

Jennifer:  And representation is so key when you're dealing with minorities (00:25:14:12 - 00:25:18:15)

Jennifer:  because we don't always have a reference point. (00:25:18:15 - 00:25:21:10)

Jennifer:  When I started off, I never knew that (00:25:21:20 - 00:25:24:16)

Jennifer:  that women even were in construction or that there was an opportunity (00:25:24:16 - 00:25:29:21)

Jennifer:  or a space for me to establish myself (00:25:29:21 - 00:25:32:23)

Jennifer:  as a demolition contractor because I didn't have a reference point. (00:25:32:23 - 00:25:36:09)

Jennifer:  I didn't even know of women owning construction companies. (00:25:36:09 - 00:25:39:08)

Jennifer:  I knew like one, you know, for like the first six or seven years of my career. (00:25:39:08 - 00:25:43:17)

Jennifer:  And that's like, oh, wow. Okay, there's one. (00:25:43:17 - 00:25:46:17)

Jennifer:  But what we know is that (00:25:47:04 - 00:25:49:04)

Jennifer:  there's always going to be someone who just needs the foundation laid. (00:25:49:20 - 00:25:53:16)

Jennifer:  And when (00:25:53:16 - 00:25:54:01)

Jennifer:  we've been able to lay the foundation, what's happened is that we've created (00:25:54:01 - 00:25:57:21)

Jennifer:  other black business owners who in turn hire more black people (00:25:57:21 - 00:26:02:08)

Jennifer:  who in turn will keep the cycle going and keep things rolling. (00:26:02:08 - 00:26:07:05)

Jennifer:  So it starts from the very, very beginning with very basic (00:26:07:05 - 00:26:11:01)

Jennifer:  fundamental training, meeting people right where they're at. Yes. (00:26:11:05 - 00:26:13:23)

Jennifer:  And so what are what are cities like? (00:26:14:15 - 00:26:17:02)

Jennifer:  So students watching watching this, what are steps that they can take to (00:26:17:03 - 00:26:21:21)

Jennifer:  to effect actual change in that department, especially now. (00:26:22:03 - 00:26:26:08)

Jennifer:  If a company wants to effect actual change, (00:26:26:08 - 00:26:29:14)

Jennifer:  one, it kind of depends on your area. (00:26:30:02 - 00:26:32:03)

Jennifer:  If you are in a major city and you are starving for employees, (00:26:32:03 - 00:26:36:23)

Jennifer:  I will say that you need to reach out (00:26:37:17 - 00:26:40:06)

Jennifer:  to the underserved, underprivileged, urban areas. (00:26:40:06 - 00:26:44:14)

Jennifer:  You need to start to recalibrate your mind that, (00:26:44:20 - 00:26:47:19)

Jennifer:  hey, there is a large group of people at home (00:26:48:00 - 00:26:51:10)

Jennifer:  waiting for that phone call, but you need to go seek them out. (00:26:51:10 - 00:26:55:10)

Jennifer:  So whether it's at the community centers (00:26:55:10 - 00:26:58:02)

Jennifer:  or outreach events or connecting with your local politicians, (00:26:58:02 - 00:27:01:09)

Jennifer:  if you really need people and you can't find anyone (00:27:02:00 - 00:27:05:18)

Jennifer:  and you're in a major city (00:27:05:18 - 00:27:07:06)

Jennifer:  that I'm going to tell you, you're not looking if you are in Detroit, (00:27:07:06 - 00:27:10:19)

Jennifer:  if you're in Atlanta, if you're in Los Angeles or Washington, D.C., (00:27:10:19 - 00:27:14:22)

Jennifer:  if you are in Denver and you're telling me you can't find anyone, (00:27:14:22 - 00:27:18:07)

Jennifer:  then you're not looking. (00:27:18:10 - 00:27:19:17)

Jennifer:  Now, if you're like in a Rexburg, Idaho, I understand you. (00:27:19:17 - 00:27:24:13)

Jennifer:  You may have a little trouble finding this talent and the skill sets (00:27:24:13 - 00:27:28:04)

Jennifer:  that you need, but from a business standpoint, (00:27:28:04 - 00:27:31:09)

Jennifer:  you should be thinking of the labor shortage as a business strategy (00:27:31:17 - 00:27:35:12)

Jennifer:  and what can you do to curb that so that your company isn't impacted (00:27:35:12 - 00:27:40:04)

Jennifer:  by the adverse effects of the labor shortage? (00:27:40:09 - 00:27:44:23)

Jennifer:  And so just by way of (00:27:44:23 - 00:27:46:16)

Jennifer:  so just by way of (00:27:49:09 - 00:27:51:07)

Jennifer:  looking at the population as a whole, you're kind of like (00:27:51:16 - 00:27:54:07)

Jennifer:  maybe like looking forward at the idea that (00:27:55:19 - 00:27:58:02)

Jennifer:  that everybody does have (00:27:58:18 - 00:28:00:19)

Jennifer:  the necessary skillset to enter any type of industry, (00:28:02:01 - 00:28:05:02)

Jennifer:  but especially construction that's been historically a monoculture. (00:28:05:02 - 00:28:10:01)

Jennifer:  I don't know that everyone has the skill (00:28:11:00 - 00:28:13:08)

Jennifer:  set to do construction because it's not easy. (00:28:13:08 - 00:28:18:01)

Jennifer:  It's hard, it's laborious, it takes time, it takes grit. (00:28:18:01 - 00:28:22:02)

Jennifer:  And you have to be you have to have the mental aptitude (00:28:22:17 - 00:28:26:11)

Jennifer:  and toughness in order to sustain in the industry. (00:28:26:18 - 00:28:31:01)

Jennifer:  Can it be very rewarding? (00:28:31:06 - 00:28:32:21)

Jennifer:  Yes, but you have to want to do the work. (00:28:32:21 - 00:28:35:11)

Jennifer:  And there is a group of people who don't want to do hard work. (00:28:35:17 - 00:28:39:05)

Jennifer:  But is that the majority know if you go into a gymnasium (00:28:39:07 - 00:28:45:03)

Jennifer:  full of people who are unemployed and you say, hey, (00:28:45:03 - 00:28:50:04)

Jennifer:  you want to work at McDonald's, you're going to be making $13 an hour. (00:28:50:19 - 00:28:54:01)

Jennifer:  No one's jumping up to say, yes, I want to do that. (00:28:54:03 - 00:28:58:00)

Jennifer:  No, but if you say, hey, look, screw all of this, I can provide you (00:28:58:00 - 00:29:02:07)

Jennifer:  with a pathway to create an opportunity for you that is going to not create a job, (00:29:02:12 - 00:29:09:00)

Jennifer:  but a career for you, that is going to help you to sustain (00:29:09:01 - 00:29:12:17)

Jennifer:  where you may start off making $15, but you could easily work up to $22. (00:29:12:23 - 00:29:17:16)

Jennifer:  Or if you're working in a prevailing wage (00:29:17:16 - 00:29:21:12)

Jennifer:  job, you could be making 45 to $60 an hour. (00:29:21:12 - 00:29:25:07)

Jennifer:  I guarantee you that people are going to stand up and say, I'll try it, (00:29:25:12 - 00:29:29:00)

Jennifer:  but they just need the access (00:29:30:00 - 00:29:31:14)

Jennifer:  and the opportunity to do it. (00:29:31:14 - 00:29:35:17)

Jennifer:  And so (00:29:35:17 - 00:29:36:23)

Jennifer:  I had to help students (00:29:39:14 - 00:29:40:23)

Jennifer:  create that access from (00:29:40:23 - 00:29:43:13)

Jennifer:  from the beginning. (00:29:44:08 - 00:29:45:17)

Jennifer:  Students can create that access by having the desire to engage. (00:29:45:17 - 00:29:50:20)

Jennifer:  So you have to be open minded. (00:29:51:09 - 00:29:53:13)

Jennifer:  You have to be willing to. (00:29:53:13 - 00:29:55:15)

Jennifer:  We talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but, you know, (00:29:55:15 - 00:29:59:00)

Jennifer:  it's more so diversity is you know, you know, (00:29:59:18 - 00:30:03:04)

Jennifer:  being invited, you know, is being invited to the dance. (00:30:03:04 - 00:30:07:02)

Jennifer:  But if you get there and no one wants to dance with you, then that's not inclusion. (00:30:07:02 - 00:30:11:09)

Jennifer:  You're just there. (00:30:11:22 - 00:30:13:05)

Jennifer:  So you don't want to be the the token or (00:30:13:05 - 00:30:16:07)

Jennifer:  the spokesperson go to spokesperson for your racial nationality. (00:30:16:07 - 00:30:20:13)

Jennifer:  That's you know, that's just overwhelming in itself. (00:30:20:13 - 00:30:24:00)

Jennifer:  What you want is you want a diverse group. (00:30:24:08 - 00:30:26:16)

Jennifer:  And what we know from studies is that diverse (00:30:26:16 - 00:30:29:20)

Jennifer:  companies make more money, they're more profitable (00:30:29:20 - 00:30:32:17)

Jennifer:  because they're more profitable because everyone has a different aspect. (00:30:33:03 - 00:30:36:22)

Jennifer:  They come from different backgrounds and different environments. (00:30:36:22 - 00:30:39:14)

Jennifer:  And so if you really want to enhance your company as a whole, (00:30:39:20 - 00:30:43:15)

Jennifer:  you would want to have a diverse group of people anyway. (00:30:43:22 - 00:30:46:22)

Jennifer:  And that's I mean, nationality wise, male and female wise, (00:30:47:03 - 00:30:50:17)

Jennifer:  but also key decision makers. (00:30:50:23 - 00:30:52:17)

Jennifer:  So if you are a decision maker within your company, you need to be (00:30:52:17 - 00:30:57:00)

Jennifer:  strategizing how you can do more outreach and what that looks like. (00:30:57:00 - 00:31:01:06)

Jennifer:  Are you going to the high schools? (00:31:01:06 - 00:31:03:07)

Jennifer:  Are you going to the colleges? (00:31:03:07 - 00:31:05:07)

Jennifer:  Are you working with local and community people? (00:31:05:07 - 00:31:09:08)

Jennifer:  Are you putting out job fairs? (00:31:09:12 - 00:31:12:15)

Jennifer:  Are you attending those things? (00:31:12:15 - 00:31:13:23)

Jennifer:  And that's how you're going to attract the people and if nothing else, (00:31:13:23 - 00:31:17:18)

Jennifer:  defer to your resources. (00:31:18:07 - 00:31:20:03)

Jennifer:  You have LinkedIn and Instagram and Facebook. (00:31:20:03 - 00:31:22:23)

Jennifer:  If you don't know, people reach out to me all the time asking, (00:31:23:05 - 00:31:26:07)

Jennifer:  What can I do for my company to attract it? (00:31:26:07 - 00:31:29:00)

Jennifer:  We're pretty vanilla right now, but we want to do more. (00:31:29:00 - 00:31:32:10)

Jennifer:  We just don't know how. (00:31:32:10 - 00:31:34:00)

Jennifer:  So if you don't know how, just ask someone in someone who has this. (00:31:34:00 - 00:31:37:22)

Jennifer:  Your interest in inclusion will be willing to help you. What (00:31:37:23 - 00:31:42:12)

Jennifer:  kind of the teen pages on so many sites (00:31:43:15 - 00:31:48:02)

Jennifer:  that of organizations that claim to have diversity initiatives. (00:31:48:02 - 00:31:53:10)

Jennifer:  You look at the leadership team and it's still (00:31:53:10 - 00:31:56:23)

Jennifer:  okay. (00:31:57:07 - 00:31:57:19)

Jennifer:  So how do we change that to you? (00:31:58:09 - 00:32:00:19)

Jennifer:  We change that by (00:32:00:19 - 00:32:03:20)

Jennifer:  I don't know. (00:32:05:01 - 00:32:06:14)

Jennifer:  Let me see how I can say this politically correct (00:32:06:14 - 00:32:09:13)

Jennifer:  companies that tout diversity, inclusion, (00:32:12:04 - 00:32:16:04)

Jennifer:  but are not putting the actionable steps behind it. (00:32:16:04 - 00:32:20:00)

Jennifer:  We know who you are and your employees know who you are, (00:32:20:16 - 00:32:24:08)

Jennifer:  and they talk about you behind your back, just so you know. (00:32:24:08 - 00:32:27:20)

Jennifer:  But what you can do is if you are an employee of a company (00:32:28:06 - 00:32:32:11)

Jennifer:  that is not diverse, sometimes people don't (00:32:32:11 - 00:32:35:16)

Jennifer:  think about something until it's brought to their attention (00:32:35:16 - 00:32:38:11)

Jennifer:  or they think it's okay because no one's ever said anything. (00:32:38:18 - 00:32:42:13)

Jennifer:  So I think that there needs to be a vehicle for employees to safely (00:32:42:21 - 00:32:47:00)

Jennifer:  say that, hey, we don't have any women in leadership, (00:32:47:00 - 00:32:50:16)

Jennifer:  we don't have any minorities in leadership. (00:32:50:21 - 00:32:52:23)

Jennifer:  And so what are we saying to the public (00:32:53:03 - 00:32:55:21)

Jennifer:  if everyone is male or (00:32:56:07 - 00:32:59:02)

Jennifer:  everyone is white or you are working for you? (00:32:59:02 - 00:33:03:11)

Jennifer:  Look, go to a website (00:33:03:11 - 00:33:05:00)

Jennifer:  and everyone is completely Latina and you say we're all about diversity. (00:33:05:00 - 00:33:08:22)

Jennifer:  It's like, well, no, you're not, because we don't see that. (00:33:08:23 - 00:33:12:21)

Jennifer:  So employees need to be able to communicate that and employers (00:33:13:07 - 00:33:18:09)

Jennifer:  need to create a safe space for employees to do just that. (00:33:18:09 - 00:33:21:21)

Jennifer:  I recommend you can even do something anonymously where the people (00:33:22:06 - 00:33:26:13)

Jennifer:  can submit their concerns or questions or suggestions for your company, (00:33:26:13 - 00:33:31:12)

Jennifer:  but also be mindful that we are living in the cancel culture. (00:33:32:01 - 00:33:35:22)

Jennifer:  So if you're not, you may get a disgruntled client or employee (00:33:36:05 - 00:33:40:12)

Jennifer:  putting you out on blast on Twitter saying that, no, it's not really like that. (00:33:41:05 - 00:33:45:15)

Jennifer:  You know, reputation is everything. (00:33:46:09 - 00:33:48:02)

Jennifer:  So you don't want to be caught in that type of quagmire. (00:33:48:02 - 00:33:50:22)

Jennifer:  So it's best to kind of move ahead forward (00:33:51:04 - 00:33:55:01)

Jennifer:  and be cognizant that the times are changing (00:33:55:01 - 00:33:57:16)

Jennifer:  and that you're going to have to change with them. (00:33:57:16 - 00:33:59:12)

Jennifer:  And I mean, (00:34:00:16 - 00:34:02:02)

Jennifer:  I think it really like people in your position (00:34:02:02 - 00:34:05:05)

Jennifer:  who have been, would you describe yourself as a solopreneur? No. (00:34:05:05 - 00:34:09:07)

Jennifer:  How would you describe? (00:34:09:19 - 00:34:10:19)

Jennifer:  I think a solopreneur only has it has no employees. (00:34:10:19 - 00:34:13:17)

Jennifer:  Yeah. (00:34:14:02 - 00:34:14:15)

Jennifer:  How would you describe your (00:34:14:16 - 00:34:16:23)

Jennifer:  kind of your career trajectory? (00:34:17:01 - 00:34:20:21)

Jennifer:  Okay. (00:34:20:21 - 00:34:21:15)

Jennifer:  So career trajectory, as far as what. (00:34:21:18 - 00:34:25:17)

Jennifer:  As far as I have, how would you describe (00:34:25:23 - 00:34:29:08)

Jennifer:  the, um, (00:34:29:08 - 00:34:31:17)

Jennifer:  the leadership position that you're in now? (00:34:32:05 - 00:34:38:03)

Jennifer:  And what does success look like to you? (00:34:38:03 - 00:34:40:09)

Jennifer:  The construction trades. (00:34:40:15 - 00:34:51:21)

Jennifer:  So leadership to me looks like being supported by your team. (00:34:51:21 - 00:34:57:02)

Jennifer:  It's great to say I, me, me, me. (00:34:57:10 - 00:34:59:22)

Jennifer:  But essentially the work is done by your team. (00:34:59:22 - 00:35:03:06)

Jennifer:  You have to have people that are just as competent. (00:35:03:14 - 00:35:07:12)

Jennifer:  And for me, I like to have people around me that are smarter than me, (00:35:07:12 - 00:35:11:06)

Jennifer:  who can execute much better than I can, because (00:35:11:13 - 00:35:14:12)

Jennifer:  then it makes me step my game up. (00:35:14:14 - 00:35:17:12)

Jennifer:  So you're only as good as your team. (00:35:17:13 - 00:35:19:08)

Jennifer:  So you're only as good as your team. (00:35:19:08 - 00:35:19:13)

Jennifer:  And so if you in construction, (00:35:19:22 - 00:35:22:16)

Jennifer:  everything is about the team and working together. (00:35:22:16 - 00:35:26:13)

Jennifer:  And so if you are a good or strong leader, you would understand (00:35:26:19 - 00:35:30:21)

Jennifer:  that like there's no way that I could possibly get a job done by myself. (00:35:30:21 - 00:35:35:01)

Jennifer:  No, I have to rely on the experts who know more than me, (00:35:35:08 - 00:35:39:18)

Jennifer:  who clearly have been in the business longer than I have. (00:35:39:20 - 00:35:42:15)

Jennifer:  For me, I'm more about the strategy of (00:35:43:05 - 00:35:46:12)

Jennifer:  how can we implement the things and take the knowledge that we have (00:35:46:19 - 00:35:50:14)

Jennifer:  and experience that we have and grow it (00:35:50:14 - 00:35:53:16)

Jennifer:  and really continue to do good work. (00:35:53:16 - 00:35:56:16)

Jennifer:  So success to me looks like, you know, (00:35:57:05 - 00:36:00:05)

Jennifer:  creating and maintaining a strong profit margin while continuing to serve (00:36:00:12 - 00:36:05:11)

Jennifer:  people who look like me and creating career and job opportunities. (00:36:05:19 - 00:36:10:13)

Jennifer:  That's what success is to me. (00:36:10:13 - 00:36:12:03)

Jennifer:  That's, um. (00:36:13:10 - 00:36:23:05)

Jennifer:  Personally. Mm hmm. (00:36:24:02 - 00:36:26:08)

Jennifer:  I think I meant. (00:36:26:08 - 00:36:26:23)

Jennifer:  I think I saw that (00:36:26:23 - 00:36:29:04)

Jennifer:  in one interview that you said that construction changed your life. (00:36:29:04 - 00:36:31:18)

Jennifer:  Yeah. About how that happened. (00:36:31:23 - 00:36:34:04)

Jennifer:  Construction definitely changed my life (00:36:34:04 - 00:36:36:19)

Jennifer:  since I was six or seven, I really thought that I was going to be a therapist. (00:36:37:09 - 00:36:42:09)

Jennifer:  That was definitely my goal and my dreams. (00:36:42:17 - 00:36:46:08)

Jennifer:  And, you know. (00:36:46:17 - 00:36:48:08)

Jennifer:  Unfortunately, it didn't happen. (00:36:48:08 - 00:36:50:08)

Jennifer:  Or fortunately it didn't happen actually, because I ended up doing construction. (00:36:50:08 - 00:36:54:22)

Jennifer:  You know, (00:36:55:06 - 00:36:55:14)

Jennifer:  I took a job at a time that I thought was, you know, just fresh out of college. (00:36:55:14 - 00:36:59:06)

Jennifer:  I thought, (00:36:59:06 - 00:36:59:23)

Jennifer:  I'm just going to do this for a little bit and then I'm going to figure out, (00:37:00:02 - 00:37:03:06)

Jennifer:  you know, what I want to really do in (00:37:03:06 - 00:37:06:17)

Jennifer:  15 years later, I figured out what I really wanted to do (00:37:07:17 - 00:37:11:00)

Jennifer:  is what I'm doing right now, and that is construction. (00:37:11:00 - 00:37:14:03)

Jennifer:  And so I know firsthand about being presented the opportunity (00:37:14:11 - 00:37:18:23)

Jennifer:  and having access to a world that I knew nothing about (00:37:19:04 - 00:37:22:12)

Jennifer:  and being able to shape it and frame it into my own. (00:37:22:18 - 00:37:26:07)

Jennifer:  So I want to ensure that I continue (00:37:26:16 - 00:37:29:20)

Jennifer:  down that path of helping others create their dreams and make their dreams (00:37:29:20 - 00:37:34:17)

Jennifer:  come true and provide for their families because ultimately we are all the same. (00:37:34:17 - 00:37:39:17)

Jennifer:  When you think about the American dream, what's the American dream? (00:37:40:03 - 00:37:43:09)

Jennifer:  Everyone wants, you know, a car or a dog or in my case, a cat. (00:37:43:09 - 00:37:48:16)

Jennifer:  And you want to have a family, you want them to be safe, (00:37:50:00 - 00:37:53:13)

Jennifer:  and you want somewhere to live that's nice and secure where you don't worry. (00:37:53:13 - 00:37:57:10)

Jennifer:  And so how can you accomplish that? (00:37:57:10 - 00:38:00:02)

Jennifer:  Construction is a vehicle to do that again. (00:38:00:02 - 00:38:02:18)

Jennifer:  It's never going to be outsourced. (00:38:02:18 - 00:38:04:14)

Jennifer:  There's always going to be room for you and as the construction (00:38:04:14 - 00:38:07:23)

Jennifer:  industry continues to grow, there is space for you. (00:38:07:23 - 00:38:11:18)

Jennifer:  You have to think it's not just about the skilled trades. (00:38:11:18 - 00:38:14:06)

Jennifer:  If you are in social media, there's a space for you. (00:38:14:07 - 00:38:17:09)

Jennifer:  If you're marketing, there's a space for you. (00:38:17:14 - 00:38:19:17)

Jennifer:  If you're a project manager, there's a space for you. (00:38:19:21 - 00:38:22:12)

Jennifer:  If you are in finance and construction, there's a space for you. (00:38:22:17 - 00:38:26:06)

Jennifer:  There's so many facets of what everyone sees that they don't really think about. (00:38:26:06 - 00:38:30:04)

Jennifer:  They just think about some guy with a tool belt getting dirty and that's it. (00:38:30:04 - 00:38:34:22)

Jennifer:  But no, there are a myriad of opportunities (00:38:34:22 - 00:38:38:09)

Jennifer:  that you could do construction, and that's construction related. (00:38:38:09 - 00:38:42:07)

Jennifer:  Today we're here filming a construction education course. (00:38:42:10 - 00:38:45:10)

Jennifer:  So if you're interested in being a trainer that teaches construction (00:38:45:10 - 00:38:49:14)

Jennifer:  or about aspects of construction, there's a space for you. (00:38:49:14 - 00:38:53:00)

Jennifer:  And so I just want people to understand (00:38:53:13 - 00:38:56:03)

Jennifer:  and know that it goes far beyond just the labor aspect. (00:38:56:03 - 00:39:00:08)

Jennifer:  And construction is also an industry where you can grow again. (00:39:00:18 - 00:39:05:00)

Jennifer:  I've been an administrative assistant, (00:39:05:00 - 00:39:06:19)

Jennifer:  I've been a superintendent, I've been a project manager, (00:39:06:19 - 00:39:09:21)

Jennifer:  I've been an estimate, and now I'm the president of my own company. (00:39:10:01 - 00:39:13:12)

Jennifer:  So there are so many jobs that you can do within the field. (00:39:13:17 - 00:39:17:02)

Jennifer:  You're not just limited to doing one thing. (00:39:17:02 - 00:39:23:01)

Jennifer:  Awesome. (00:39:23:01 - 00:39:23:10)

Jennifer:  What else haven't been (00:39:25:05 - 00:39:26:17)

Jennifer:  covered in some way? (00:39:26:17 - 00:39:30:00)

Jennifer:  I don't know (00:39:30:00 - 00:39:31:03)

Jennifer:  about straight at (00:39:32:00 - 00:39:34:01)

Jennifer:  Langley. (00:39:34:01 - 00:39:34:11)

Jennifer:  You have something that I should cover that I haven't (00:39:34:11 - 00:39:36:14)

Jennifer:  covered. Now, my. (00:39:37:23 - 00:39:39:16)

Jennifer:  My husband just said there's nothing more (00:39:39:16 - 00:39:43:05)

Jennifer:  professional. (00:39:46:14 - 00:39:47:08)

Jennifer:  Okay? (00:39:47:17 - 00:39:48:10)

Jennifer:  But I don't know. Nelson. (00:39:48:10 - 00:39:50:04)

Jennifer:  He was gunning for your job. (00:39:50:04 - 00:39:51:09)

Jennifer:  You left your seat, and he was. (00:39:51:09 - 00:39:53:00)

Jennifer:  He was like, a directorship is coming. (00:39:53:00 - 00:39:55:02)

Jennifer:  It's coming (00:39:55:02 - 00:39:56:10)

Jennifer:  from so obviously. (00:39:57:20 - 00:39:58:14)

Jennifer:  So I'm happy that (00:39:58:14 - 00:40:00:00)

Jennifer:  these (00:40:01:01 - 00:40:01:18)

Jennifer:  new voices (00:40:03:07 - 00:40:04:18)

Jennifer:  cool. (00:40:05:11 - 00:40:05:21)

Jennifer:  Okay so they want (00:40:05:21 - 00:40:07:20)

Jennifer:  to call my questions. (00:40:07:22 - 00:40:09:15)

Jennifer:  You can do whatever you want. And I suppose. (00:40:09:15 - 00:40:12:11)

Jennifer:  I could share one message to the next generation (00:40:12:11 - 00:40:14:22)

Jennifer:  of construction workers. (00:40:15:12 - 00:40:17:13)

Jennifer:  Oh, let me think about that. (00:40:18:12 - 00:40:24:15)

Jennifer:  If I can share one message with the next generation (00:40:24:15 - 00:40:27:21)

Jennifer:  of construction workers is that (00:40:27:21 - 00:40:30:10)

Jennifer:  it's out there. (00:40:31:12 - 00:40:32:23)

Jennifer:  Be open, be willing, be ready. (00:40:32:23 - 00:40:36:18)

Jennifer:  There is space for you. (00:40:37:00 - 00:40:39:02)

Jennifer:  It doesn't matter what you look like, what your demographics are, (00:40:39:02 - 00:40:42:07)

Jennifer:  where you come from, what your nationality is. (00:40:42:07 - 00:40:45:01)

Jennifer:  Just know that in the industry of construction there is space for you. (00:40:45:11 - 00:40:50:13)

Jennifer:  And if you are young and you love watching, (00:40:50:22 - 00:40:55:17)

Jennifer:  I don't know a doja cat in the Migos, you don't have to. (00:40:55:17 - 00:40:59:16)

Jennifer:  You're not going to be the next LeBron James and that's okay. (00:40:59:21 - 00:41:02:08)

Jennifer:  But know that there is a space for you in construction and you can make (00:41:02:19 - 00:41:06:02)

Jennifer:  just as much money as they're making. (00:41:06:08 - 00:41:08:08)

Jennifer:  And there are a lot of blue collar millionaires. (00:41:09:12 - 00:41:12:16)

Jennifer:  So if the money aspect is something that you really care about, (00:41:12:19 - 00:41:16:13)

Jennifer:  you can work very hard to achieve that success. (00:41:16:22 - 00:41:19:14)

Jennifer:  But if you want a career that is long standing (00:41:19:23 - 00:41:23:06)

Jennifer:  and you don't have to worry about if you're going to have a job tomorrow, (00:41:23:06 - 00:41:28:01)

Jennifer:  then construction industry is a place for you to fill. (00:41:28:01 - 00:41:31:23)

Jennifer:  Worlds not going anywhere. (00:41:32:00 - 00:41:35:08)

Jennifer:  Awesome (00:41:35:08 - 00:41:36:04)

Jennifer:  house. (00:41:37:14 - 00:41:38:05)

Jennifer:  No, I don't think so. (00:41:39:10 - 00:41:43:02)

Jennifer:  All right, let's go. Z Iran. That's right. (00:41:43:12 - 00:41:46:17)
