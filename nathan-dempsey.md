# Nathan Dempsey

Jack Bowen: So where are you calling from today?

Nathan Dempsey: And Bristol?

Jack Bowen: Cool. I'm in London.

Nathan Dempsey: Where in London?

Jack Bowen: in my place in the West West End. Oh, nice. Nice. There. We'll work from home by today. So absolutely, yeah.

Nathan Dempsey: Also days those good days

Jack Bowen: they are Yeah. Yeah. As a friend, I used to work in the same office as this guy. And he would like, he's like, supposed to come in. And then he didn't show up. And he was just sort of like, I was like, you know what's going on? And he was like, Oh, I slept in a bit late. I couldn't find any socks. So just decided it wasn't my day.

Nathan Dempsey: Great. It's actually now, I mean, like five years ago, that would have been awful. But now you can just do that can't you.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, exactly. That was like a sack of all offence five years ago. And now it's like,

Nathan Dempsey: more exciting new world. Exactly. Um, well, look, Thanks

Jack Bowen: for Thanks for jumping on a call with me. And yeah, time to talk about G. C, I guess like, just as a kind of quick intro. Like, it'd be super helpful to just hear that, though. Like, your, your particular use case a bit about what you're working on, like how you found us that kind of thing?

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah, sure. So I was doing my master's. And I was using it for my dissertation, particularly from a lit review. As well as like literature for my essays. And I was using Gini a lot. I mean, it found it honestly, it points it felt like a bit of a cheat code. Okay. It was like, you know, obviously, it doesn't give you everything you need to go over, go over to get like exact quotes and everything like that. But I found that it just kind of perfectly captured the things I wanted from a, from a piece of work. I just wanted a quick understanding. So I was using it a lot, basically for the last few months.

Jack Bowen: Okay. And what were you studying? Public

Nathan Dempsey: Policy? Okay, so I would use it for all sorts of uses for academic documents. I would use it for policy documents. Yeah, so I would use it for all sorts of things. And it was really, really useful for all of them.

Jack Bowen: Okay, and did you use so you on pro did you use like the search features as well? In the note taking everything? Okay. Yeah, yeah. Got it. And what was the like, and how did you find Genie? Like, what was the what was your read into it?

Nathan Dempsey: My route into it was a friend said, Oh, I found this thing. You should try it. I like a guy a friend on my course. I said, Oh, yeah, let's I went, I think it was a free trial. And immediately, it just like sped up my work so much. I was like, able to get a good grasp of readings quite quickly, and then follow up. You know, what I needed to follow up on through the readings themselves. So yeah, once I've done that, I was like, wow, so I thought I started off on the basic one, not the pro one. But as it came to dissertation, I thought I might as well just kind of pay the extra money to get the pro version just because I was gonna I knew I was going to use it.

Jack Bowen: And what like, What motivated you to upgrade to pro? Is it like, better summarise

Nathan Dempsey: this? Yeah, well, I just wanted to be able to use all of the different functions and the vet summaries kind of tailor what I needed a bit more. Which I think pro allowed me to do.

Jack Bowen: Okay. And have you ever recommended it to anyone?

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah, loads of people. Okay, well, nice. People, like friends who do masters at other unis all sorts. Yeah, just like downloaded now. And one of my friends is just like, oh my god, I'm so happy. recommended this to me. I can't believe it.

Jack Bowen: Okay, nice. And like, how does it come up in conversation? Like, how do you what? What prompts you to recommend it to someone?

Nathan Dempsey: They're talking, they're like, Oh, my God, I've got so much reading. I'm finding it so hard. I was like, well, Eugenie, it smooth, it makes the whole the whole, the whole process so much quicker. And if you need to go further into it, you can. Okay, um, yeah.

Jack Bowen: And are they are they are they studying like similar things to you? Like, what what? Do you notice any? Is there any, are there any patterns in terms of like, the type of

Nathan Dempsey: I mean, I don't know anyone who is doing kind of like deep scientific work, it would be mainly kind of humanities based. So I couldn't tell you whether they're mainly doing other kinds of like, political science, international relations, that kind of stuff. Yeah. So they're kind of all similar areas, but because I don't know how it would deal with say like something And typical.

Jack Bowen: Okay, got it? And okay. What, um, how can you turn? Like, what was the sort of what was the reason to that you stopped using a

Nathan Dempsey: master's finished? So I had no, no real need for it. I think so I'm applying for jobs at the moment in some research works just trying to see what's about my work wise and I think if I say got a job doing research based stuff, I'd definitely start paying for Jeanne again. Or even policy, if I was doing a policy job, it would be a brilliant way to get through policy documents quickly. Like it does that. There are there were times, if I were to kind of reflect on it, they sometimes got a bit confused with headings, which could sometimes complicate that, you know, I mean, yeah, headings, page numbers sometimes got a bit confused. But you can kind of work around it. But yeah, definitely pay for it again.

Jack Bowen: Okay, and were there any other problems that you notice? Like, were there any other things that could have improved in it? Like when did it like, go wrong, or like petiole?

Nathan Dempsey: Sometimes it would bug out. It just wouldn't load a document. So it would get, you know, you'd ask for the compute the different sections, and it would just be sat there for like, a day day and a half. Just do you know, I mean, yeah. So I mean, I guess it's to be expected, right? It's like going through all these documents. There wasn't like, there were points. It was a bit annoying. And then I found sometimes trying to click through into the document took ages as well. Oh, like when you know, when you when it when it comes to computer summary. And then you can click on the summary to go into the document. Sometimes that would take ages because you'd want to look in,

Jack Bowen: right, okay.

Nathan Dempsey: Any other other than that, I can't really think of anything. Yeah, that was an issue.

Jack Bowen: What about any of that? Did you What about any problems? Or like search? Or like the Note linking stuff? Or?

Nathan Dempsey: No, that was genuinely fine. Actually, that was genuinely find the search, and I didn't use those functions. A huge amount. Okay. But when I did they worked fine for me.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Okay, got it. Mmm. Interesting. And are there any ways in which you could have made it better? Like, let's say we fixed all those problems, like, the confusion with headings, the attribution of sentences, like, what what would have was there anything else that was still kind of missing that, like problems that you still had, even even though you're using it?

Nathan Dempsey: One thing I will say is, you know, when it says, decide which kind of how long you want your summaries to be like, you can have short, blah, blah, like the short ones were really short. But then for the other two, I actually found that they kind of, like the middle one was fine, but they just kind of belong on was really confused some of the things that it would compute. It just wasn't a you know, I mean, it didn't make kind of sometimes it just wouldn't make that much sense. The summary that would bring up it'd be kind of really, really like confused sentences and points. Yeah, so that would be one of the ones I kind of kept it on. I believe. I'm having to wrack my brain a bit here. But I had to kind of leave it on the middle length one. And the short one was also just too short. Okay. But I guess that's also to do with the documents. I was trying to go policy documents and things.

Jack Bowen: Okay. Um, and like when you were using it, what was your process for using it? Like how did you did you need like summarising things and then taking notes elsewhere? Or like how are you?

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah, so what I would do was I would do the you know, you can do add it into the notes section. Yeah, I was adding to what I would do was I would copy the Harvard citation to the top of the note section. Then I would go through finding the relevant notes and read the relevant things I wanted adding them in with that plus button on the left hand side yeah, into the notes section. Going into find any any ones that I needed, like further clarification or a longer close quote, or page reference, I would go in and then I would copy and paste that into a Word document, which I would then work through into a plan that was the way I use it. Yeah, that was one thing actually. Sorry. That's one thing I was gonna say is like because sometimes with the when you know when you're adding you want to kind of individual note page for each separate. Do you know I mean, yeah, document rather than a, rather than having that one single one which you have to Copy, Paste, Delete, then go through to the next one. It was maybe ease Need to have like a separate note page for each document you're using. Okay, so you can make your own kind of like notes and stuff. Yeah,

Jack Bowen: we've actually added that now in our new version of sheets, but more. You ever feel like checking it out again?

Nathan Dempsey: I mean, if I ever get a job that requires me to do lots of reading, I'm 100% going to be getting Genie again. Nice. Yeah. I honestly, I have one friend who's like, you've literally saved my life. This has changed my whole unit experience.

Jack Bowen: That's great to hear. Yeah, this is the new one. So you can like Yeah. Yeah, basically just kind of take notes in these like tabs or whatever. And you can like, Yeah, okay. And then you got your to do list and everything. Yeah. Okay, that's great. And then the summary is like, all tab as well. So you can just kind of like you can close the document and just basically, yeah, lay it out however you want.

Nathan Dempsey: Oh, that's much better. Yeah, I'm just gonna see that.

Jack Bowen: Those in whatever. Yeah, but yeah. Okay, cool. I'm trying to think Are there any other questions you think I should ask you?

Nathan Dempsey: And questions you think I should ask me? I would say I'm trying to think what I would ask if, I mean, there were points where I felt like, Am I doing something wrong? Using Genie? You know, I made the point where I was like, Is this making it too easy? Am I like, do you not? Do you know what I mean? And whether, like, Is my uni found out about reusing it? Would they be pissed off with me? Do you know what I mean? Because you're like, at points, it felt a bit like it. Like I said, it felt a bit like a cheat code. Yeah. So there was this kind of like, This is amazing. But I also felt a bit like, Oh, God, is this like, kind of kind of cheating, the kind of like the process of academic rigour I think in a professional environment, it's like, it makes perfect sense, right, you're doing it quickly. I just wondered whether in an academic environment, I don't know whether University seeing that programme would be like, this is, you know, I mean,

Jack Bowen: yeah, it's interesting. I guess it's like, yeah, I mean, I have thought about that before. I feel like that might suggest occasion was that like, you know, in the past, like the style and style and quality of writing was something that was graded as well. And you know, that everyone uses Grammarly. So it's like, it's kind of it's clearly like, uh, you know, there's a line that we draw somewhere, right?

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah. 100%? Yeah, that's

Jack Bowen: that's an interesting point. I was looking through our feedback the other day found there was someone from a high school who there are, their school had actually banned our tool.

Nathan Dempsey: mean, I think part of the reason is it cuts your work down by just hours. So something that would have taken me two weeks to do, say, 15 readings, and working through notes in a day, you know what I mean? And it makes everything I mean, like, you know, it doesn't really make any mistakes in terms of the summary. That's what's kind of amazing about it. But you know, I can see if you're someone who's like, trying particularly for like, I think at a master's level is different. You're just trying to get through as much as possible as quickly as possible because you've got so much information you need to get through. But I can see if you're trying to, like, push people to get used to the like, academic rigour, it'd be not. I mean, I can see why there may be some kind of draw drawbacks for you as a like, institution or like a teacher or something. Yeah. I mean, from my, I mean, I had no qualms about doing it. It just came across my mind every so often.

Jack Bowen: That's interesting. Yeah. Going off on a bit of a tangent, I'm kind of curious with political science, do you? Like is there a lot of like, interviewing? Or like,

Nathan Dempsey: yeah, yeah. And so I do a lot of kind of firsthand. Yeah, qualitative research work. Yeah. How does that work?

Jack Bowen: Like the qualitative research, like, do you Is it is it like, because, okay, so like, for instance, you know, we've like run surveys before and we also just have calls like this one, we just kind of freeform talk about stuff. And like, I'll take some notes and kind of look at them afterwards. And, you know, do with a couple people and like, see what the patterns are? How does it work in your field, like when you do like a qualitative study?

Nathan Dempsey: Depends what methods you're using really, like you can do survey work, which would kind of get you a mixture of kind of, like, it's qualitative in one sense, but then you can extrapolate quantitative data from that if you know what I mean. So there's different ways that the survey things can work. I personally, having done lots of survey work in a professional environment, in my job before I kind of avoid them, I think they you end up getting the answers you want. Rather than saying an interview through like a narrative or case studies, you get much more of like, accurate experience, if you know, I mean, it really depends on what you're trying to get, are you trying to get, like, big scale information about all users, then a survey is gonna work for you perfectly. But if you're wanting to understand like a system and how people interact with the system, I always think these kinds of what you're talking about that kind of narrative interview account thing is going to be much more useful. But obviously, when you're doing dealing with policies, because they're national, and you want to get a big section, it's quite hard to you do not I mean, it's quite hard to utilise those kinds of methods. across across platforms, basically,

Jack Bowen: what some what makes it difficult, is it like just getting the number of people to commit to the research?

Nathan Dempsey: Okay, yeah, yeah, finding people to commit is the hardest thing. I mean, finding people to say, I am willing to sit down and give you because like, realistically, you have to ask for half an hour. Because, you know, anything less than half an hour is going to be, you know, the conversation might last 20 minutes, but you want them to commit to that half hour. And, you know, lots of people don't have that time to give it you know, I mean, so yeah. It's hard to kind of, I mean, I was working for, for, you know, Citizens Advice. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I've heard of that. Yeah. Yeah. So I worked for Citizens Advisory many years, local level, and even people who are like, you know, not working or whatever, it's quite hard for them to commit to something. So yeah, it's finding those people willing and ready to commit to get the information you need, basically. And that's why people use surveys, basically, because they're quicker, easier, that kind of thing.

Jack Bowen: Okay, interesting. And do you? Is it? Is it? Um, are there any problems with like, processing that data afterwards? Like, how, how does it work? Once you like, do an interview like is that?

Nathan Dempsey: So there's loads of different ways you can do it? So you can do? You call it coding, okay. So you do kind of, you can do manual coding, which is what I would go for, which is you go through, you, kind of you would have to watch, call it dictate and transcribe the interview? Yeah. Then what you do is you go through finding themes, themes, or whatever, and you either highlight or, you know, I mean, you create a kind of list of different themes that have come out through that conversation, you then create with all of those, you see, you do that to each different conversation you do. And then once you've done that, then what you can start doing is to create, do you know, I mean, you're getting kind of like meta narratives, narratives that are kind of like, consistent throughout all of your different interviews. And then that kind of that there's a way that's the manual coding, or you can use this like software called IVs. Heard of invivo.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, I have a second the other day. I've just been curious about this, because it's like, it's a known thing, a lot of at the moment, these calls, and I saw NVivo. And there are other ones, like, what's the general feeling about the tools out there, they

Nathan Dempsey: like, I've never used them, because I quite like particularly when you've done an interview, to sit, because, you know, the software's never going to understand lots of stuff that go like, you know, I'm a, I did anthropology as my, my first degree. And a lot of that is about understanding the kind of minutiae of conversation, which things like in vivo aren't going to capture necessarily. Yeah, but they're really good if you're doing a lot of data. So like, if you're doing a lot of interviews, and vivo will be perfect. I guess then the hard part comes with transcription, that's, that's always going to be your most, your most difficult and also those the transcripts, the digital transcription services, again, make a lot of mistakes. I mean, which is part of the problem. Okay, to be fair, it's something you know, if you weren't thinking about how to kind of get Genie do do kind of different functions on Genie getting some sort of like transcription and coding software for qualitative research are things like that you could do there's a real I think there'll be a really interesting way of making the software applicable Do you know I mean, this is

Jack Bowen: this is something I'll yell kind of I'm I can I'll take normally like this he says I've been thinking about so let me show you this real quick. We looked at like finance as like a industry at one point for like some what we can like summarise

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah, I did a lot of I did a lot of work. I worked for an investor relations firm for ages. And again, it's a lot of like, speaking to people finding it, finding out things, all of that kind of stuff. And yeah, a service like this would have been fucking so much easier for me.

Jack Bowen: Okay, so like, I'll show you so basically like this, these are these like some transcripts I've made from like calls I had with people in like finance. And so I was kind of trying it out, like, you know, just trying to figure out what are the main problems? That you can see the the problems?

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah. Okay,

Jack Bowen: stuff like this, I mean, it's gone to the wrong one because it's not as particularly for it, but like you can sort of see like clean extract text as his problem requires reading a bunch of stupid documents.

Nathan Dempsey: Yeah. Isn't it? It's doing the kind of coding for you in a way there.

Jack Bowen: Yeah. So I was kind of thinking like, maybe, yeah, maybe something along the lines of this. But you know, then you can just sort of like tag the, I guess, like at the answers in or whatever. But yeah, I don't know. It's not an area I know, loads about. So like, I've kind of seen it in the context that we're doing it right now. Which is like, you know, across these sorts of conversations, like, you know, noting things down from them, but like, Yeah, I'm just I don't know loads about how it works in industry. And like, whether it's whether it's like a big issue.

Nathan Dempsey: I mean, you know, who would be really the people you want to be looking at is people like the UX, proper UX researchers and give them a go on, like, give them a trial, doing UX research and using your using genie to do proper UX research and see how they because they kind of utilise loads of research methods, if you know what I mean.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting one in UX research. Because there are loads of tools out there. Like this is the classic one that you see everyone talking about. And if you know these guys, thematic,

Nathan Dempsey: yeah, I have heard of them. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: But they're all very like, text based. So they'll take your support email, or your like support intercom channel, and like, code all the responses in there. But it was just kind of curious, like, yeah, what people do with like phone calls or whatever?

Nathan Dempsey: Well, so that's where I was gonna say is this, it would be interesting if you could kind of link because obviously, that stuff will do you kind of back end information, if you know what I mean, you give you a kind of an understanding of what you need to look at. But when you're going into kind of the depths of what's the actual, you know, I mean, the depths of what's going on, I think it'd be interesting to see whether you have, like how you can get that information, say about, like someone's experience into a programme where you can then code it really quickly and easily that isn't necessarily in vivo.

Jack Bowen: It's I know, I'm getting quite interested. But like, there's this other tool. I don't know if you've heard of this, like, Elissa,

Nathan Dempsey: they do this thing for like, yeah, I have heard of this. Yeah.

Jack Bowen: So like, you know, you can create these like columns. And if you've seen this, so you can, you can kind of rank them like and then you can add in your own, you can add in your own column. So you can do that. But I didn't know sort of thing you something like that. But like for interview, so you could have all your interviews here and then ask your question, and then

Nathan Dempsey: 100% Well, it'd be really useful to have that in mind kind of like a programme. If not, I mean, it'd be I think I've not used in vivo. So lots of people would say, I know lots of people kind of swear by NVivo, particularly people who do like mass amounts of qualitative like narrative stuff. I just don't mind doing it. Because I like particularly with my interviews, I like to be able to sit and be really like, hands on with it, you know what I mean? Then be able to code kind of, because I think it helps me understand what I'm looking for. But different kinds of UI UX research would be a really good interesting way in because they definitely do, like proper qualitative research. They're doing a lot of interviews, and it'd be interesting to see how that they may have different programmes they're using.

Jack Bowen: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. There's one called bite something, but just quickly, is there anyone? Do you anyone who's still working at Citizens Advice? Like you're still there?

Nathan Dempsey: So I'm assuming what we'll be doing is so my, I've got I'm probably at the end of October, I'll be doing my next round of research stuff for them. Because I'm just doing it as a consultant at the moment while I look for other jobs, so I'm doing some consultancy research for them. But it's just a small local level. So it's just in Harringay in Tottenham. Okay. So that's the Citizens Advice I work for. But yeah, so I'd be I'm going to be doing a I'm basically gonna be moving my dissertation research into a local report. So I'll be doing extra extra interviews, that kind of thing. So I'll be doing some qualitative research again, then probably next time.

Jack Bowen: Got it. Okay, really interesting. Um, do you would you be opposed if I like maybe reach out in like, a couple of weeks again, like, it's something we're like, playing around with is an idea. And it sounds like you've got a tonne of experience with it. And

Nathan Dempsey: yeah, no, 100% I'd be I'd be well up for that. It'd be interesting. I mean, I mean, the the organisation don't have like, the part of the problem for working with those organisations, typically, in the charity sector, if you want it to move into there is lots of them just don't have the funds to pay for do you not? I mean, yeah. But it'd be interesting to see particularly for, say, senior management. And so like senior management, and people on the kind of the more kind of senior level, whether they would use the tool to go through a policy documents to check policy updates to look at, you know, I mean, all that kind of stuff. As well as do it for say research things, things like that. So it'd be quite useful. I think it might be quite useful. So, okay, cool.

Jack Bowen: Um, well, look, let me let me put something on me I'd make you know, and yeah, if you're not opposed to, I'd love to like message you again. But right now we're, we're just kind of assessing the, like, effectiveness, like just being a bit of a kind of Reki on like, you know, feedback for products so far, etc. And so but after that, we're gonna get into like our next cycle, and I think I'm kind of thinking like audio video qual research might be an interesting one. So yeah, it'd

Nathan Dempsey: be really, I mean, if you could figure out some way to add a like, even like a vague transcription thing into into it, it would be do you know, I mean, sometimes those it would just be in be able to organise that kind of thing. We'll just wait input interviews in. Yeah, it'd be that would be that's the kind of a really interesting next step, I think.

Jack Bowen: Got it. Awesome. Um, well, look, thank you. Thank you so much for your time that I really appreciate you taking the time to speak the Yeah, and thank you as well for answering my slightly left field questions about

Nathan Dempsey: Well, thank you for Janie because it's honestly it was a lifesaver. So yeah.

Jack Bowen: Thank you so much. Awesome. All right. Um, speaks in speaks in Jagex. Yeah, they might
