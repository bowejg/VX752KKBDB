nice to see you again.

0:02
Sorry.

0:02
Nice to see you again.

0:03
Yes.

0:04
Likewise.

0:05
Cool.

0:07
how have you been?

0:08
How's work quite busy actually.

0:11
Still alright, in that case we won't take up loads of your time then.

0:16
So I guess just kind of falling on from the last chat we have had we we spoke to a few other cool researchers and had a few more interviews and I think we kind of feel like perhaps what we developed with this chat, but might might need a bit more kind of research and iteration on the user front, if that makes sense?

0:38
I think there was certainly some like points that came out of it that, you know, we discussed a lot of the feedback as a team and and sort of found that we had like a few more questions that sort of raised a few more questions so yeah, one of you be kind of keen to just sort of run through a few of those and sort of give us your thoughts really as a professional.

0:59
Right?

0:59
Sure.

1:00
I think I actually looked up something, it's a lot of talk about what's it called.

1:08
Yeah.

1:09
So is your thing something that is kind of a similar Yeah, it's same similar technology.

1:17
I think it's some thing is like chat G.

1:20
T.

1:23
kind of runs like it's sort of it's a sort of generative generative ai and and you know whatever using similar models and I think our differentiation was basically going to be around like providing references back to your own material.

1:36
So one thing that chat GPT doesn't do is it doesn't have like your context or sort of your your frame of reference and it struggles quite a lot with like factual accuracy.

1:46
So it's good for creative tasks.

1:48
Like I don't know what questions should I ask in this interview and it can write you a list but you can't like you can't give it a bunch of your data and sort of ask it to help you analyze it because it just doesn't it doesn't have that like you know that that frame of reference.

2:00
Really?

2:03
Okay.

2:03
Yeah.

2:04
Did you ever play around with it?

2:05
I heard about it sort of conference about it and wanted to try it but it was wasn't available for some reason.

2:14
So I just couldn't couldn't really access.

2:17
Was that the one with, what's his name?

2:19
Mike mike mike stevens possibly.

2:23
Yeah.

2:24
We had a chat with one of his colleagues, Richard though and as well from we we kind of we had we had a long chat about about chat GPT but I think it's sort of yeah, there's a lot of potential there and I think we're kind of you know, we're sort of excited to see how we can how we can sort of mold that to to qualitative research.

2:48
So I guess like following on from my chat like we you know, we spoke to a few more of a few other folks and like it kind of I think are kind of main questions that were sort of wondering about the moment?

3:00
really are.

3:03
So it was one it was one thing that you sort of alluded to which was like you know we've been you know kind of pushing this value proposition of working faster but we're not actually sure whether that is the most I guess like meaningful access for improvement for people doing qualitative research.

3:27
I was wondering if I could kind of get your view on that.

3:28
So one thing that another researcher said was like you know, we already work quite quickly you know especially compared with like academia it's very like results driven and there's a sort of outcome and actually like you know people, you know, researchers are paid for their insight and their analysis and so like speeding that up might not be the sort of most relevant value proposition I guess to researcher.

3:56
So we had a brainstorm and like some of the other things I guess that kind of came out of other calls perhaps were like for for areas areas that people would want to improve on were like coverage of material confidence and and bias as being some other some other areas in which people would want to see like a would find value in meaningful value in like a 10 X.

4:17
Improvement.

4:18
What do y'all like thoughts on that?

4:20
Do you think that's like a is that a valid point or I don't know what they what do they mean by bias or what do you mean by Well like so the situation was like eww you know you've got all this data, you've you've drafted your report and you kind of want to be certain that you're being objective about how you're interpreting the feedback.

4:41
So the example was someone did a project for Levi's where they wanted to launch like a suit company and they got a lot of feedback and there was sort of mixed results but the team were very excited about doing that as a product as a project.

4:56
And so they kind of just pushed it through anyway.

5:00
And then you know, lo and behold like you know to this day that no one's really heard of a levi suit And and it sort of didn't work and and so like and then in two minutes.

5:12
Yeah and so and so like for them it was like that was kind of their example.

5:20
They were like if people have more like clarity and objective about what they were looking at then they might not have done that.

5:26
I don't know because I think as a researcher, if you're addressing period of research sir researcher and not a research team or someone who is part of the end client and the brand.

5:39
These guys the brands might get overexcited sometimes the marketing guys but I don't think to be honest that that's such a risk for for for us because we are quite critical about you know criticize a lot about the we find the negatives we we highlight the weaknesses and stuff.

6:02
So I wouldn't say bias in that sense.

6:05
The only bias would be that a lot of the time we work we work alone and there could be a self bias if you like of just overlooking things or maybe having another a fresh pair of eyes so to speak just to you know to look at the data and maybe that would come up with things that one has overlooked because well because one is is not perfect because yeah, someone could be biased in just not wanting to taking into account an aspect or a dimension which you know for your own reasons maybe you've you've felt you've got to it's it's kind of noise and I don't want to take into account.

6:47
But maybe sometimes if someone else reads it or or sees the data as your system would offer a sort of in depth and broad view of everything that might come up with another light and could kind of say maybe yeah maybe I should you know investigate that dimension or bring it out in my report a bit more because indeed you know the subjective read of the data has and of course if if I don't agree with it, I could just see it now.

7:19
You know it's a it's a valid valid point or fair point but you know, I will choose to ignore it but at least I've I've actually ticked it off as being okay that has been covered.

7:29
I am aware of it, I have just decided to ignore it or overlook it or integrate it in another bit or something.

7:36
So in that sense bias it would be more like counteracting one's own weaknesses if you see what I mean.

7:45
Yeah I think I think it's it's it's quite interesting like I was reading about I read an article about some of the sort of limitations or critiques of like qualitative research and like I think the sort of human element of it is powerful but also like as you say, it seems like it can be one thing it talked about and I guess it's probably with participants was like was like reactivity.

8:08
So like people's tendency to just kind of talk about their most recent experiences if you ask them a question.

8:14
And so I I don't know is that is that like an issue in the analysis stage as well?

8:19
Do you feel like Yeah does that play into like a kind of I suppose like potential area for improvement when one is analyzing data like you know I guess having that fresh pair of eyes or having a sort of alternative view on things that you personally when you're analyzing it might be clouded by your own past experience or the analysis past experience you mean versus yes.

8:48
I don't know.

8:49
I don't know if we're always experienced I don't know if we've always experienced you know, a topic that we're covering.

8:58
So I don't know if you're always, I don't know what it's good sometimes to put some of yourself in but it's more just to see how you relate to or how that helps you understand what someone else is saying just because you can relate to it even if you don't feel the same way and sometimes it helps also because someone is telling you about something and you because you can relate to it you even if the the persons whatever the person sharing is not crystal clear.

9:25
You get it because you yourself can relate to that feeling or that experience, but so I don't really think that's I don't really think that's okay.

9:40
What about do you ever do you ever like get somebody else to like proof read, proof, read your analysis or your report?

9:51
And there's kind of a yeah I have a follow up question to that but like I suppose is that something that you do, that's what's my point about the bias thing is that you know, most of the time I would be working alone and when I do work as a team up with someone.

10:10
Yeah I do sometimes get the sense that this is more I'm more confident or I'm more relaxed.

10:17
That's what we've done is good because we've discussed it and we've refined it and and read on on you know how to twist a sentence or to express a finding in such a way that it's yeah, this is it on your own.

10:30
You don't necessarily have the possibility to have it proof proof to be proofread and to be completely, you know, this virus.

10:39
But then again I'm working a lot of time with agencies and stuff and we might, you know, we might share I'll get some feedback.

10:51
So if something isn't clear people, what did you mean by or or or sometimes just a verbal conversation deliverable.

11:01
That's not necessarily presentation.

11:02
But it's kind of a debrief could be a presentation as well, then it's interactive.

11:07
So you you do sometimes when you leave an exchange like that kind of take some notes and during the exchange and then you know, fix a few points in your in your findings if you like.

11:19
But it's sometimes down to the quality of the expression of what you've written as opposed to to the finding itself.

11:28
You see the difference.

11:29
Yeah like yeah they did it that it's not it might not be because it's sometimes quite conflict, complex, subtle things that are about people how they feel about something, how they view market.

11:44
So it's about perceptions, it's not necessarily solid behaviors and even if it is behaviors, it's I've just done something on motorcycles and I've just done my top line summary but you know, I'm sort of simplifying things because obviously there's about a dozen people and they don't all have exactly the same view of the same pattern.

12:05
So it's just like okay, I'm gonna get rid of all the specifics because that would take forever.

12:09
It's not much interest.

12:10
I'm just going to try and find the common common aspects and the dominating aspects.

12:15
So it's a bit rough but that's the deal they want.

12:18
It's kind of my read of what I heard and the main points without actually getting into too much noise unless it's a golden nugget and say, ha just one person said that, but that reveals a lot of other things, but in this instance there was none of that.

12:33
It was much more about general behavior.

12:35
So yeah, so the proof reading, I think b again more in the sense that you might be biased and that you might have some, if your system can actually pick out something or several things and then you check it out and you say right, it's really kind of insisting on this dimension and I really haven't covered it so much and and it's kind of making that as kind of a priority just because it's compiled all this data and it's really find that this is not strong, but having said that, I'm thinking about the, you know, the these world word clouds things.

13:17
It's really sexy thing when you look at it.

13:20
But actually when I used it on these platforms and stuff, it sucks totally.

13:24
I mean just, it's out of proportion in some, some see a sort of banal word huge and it actually doesn't reflect, so it's, it's cool looking, but actually I find that it's, I would much more believe in my own if I had time to design it manually.

13:40
If I think my word cloud, you know, would probably have a different, it would be this, it wouldn't be the same equivalent on what it's based on.

13:52
I think I just find that it's, I'd be able to, you know, to, to select, let's say the words again.

14:00
It's a bit like you have this, the image you used last time you want to be the the driver or the captain in command and you want to, so you're fine having, you know, suggestions from Watson, but you want to remain charlotte calls the one with the, you know, the real Yeah, so it's nice to have another point of view or hypothesis and you can see and it's very nice to say that that's not right, but I like hearing it and it just only confirms me that I'm I'm I'm going the right route because I've dismissed something which might have appeared logical, but actually isn't valuable for whatever reasons I've.

14:41
Okay.

14:41
Do you do you ever get like a I guess like a sort of contradictory like forms of contradictory feedback Like I don't know I guess where like you said you mentioned you work by yourself but like when somebody sits down and says like I don't agree with this point or like I actually interpret this differently.

15:03
And is that ever helpful?

15:05
Yeah it would be but I don't necessarily I'm not exposed to that often but when I do it's not necessarily that we disagree.

15:13
It's more that we it's the we try and make sense of it and there's a sort of emphasis on something or other or or you know is this I really think I don't honestly think there's disagreement so much because I think the findings that we come across and and bring to our true you know are valid even if it's well even if it's it's because it's cool that it's valid as opposed to it even if it's not quantifiable, it's still valid.

15:46
It's intelligent stuff but it's it's more about yeah as I said it's more about refining the thing as opposed to disagreeing.

15:59
Okay and I mean like one example that really stuck out last time we spoke was you mentioned this project for Perrier that you did and and then yeah how after after you submitted it you then had that like I remember you said you had that moment where you saw on the menu which category it was and from, from we spoke, I think I think eventually actually already submitted the report by that point.

16:30
Is that like a, I don't know like I guess to, to break ranks slightly and talk about any solutions or problem focused?

16:40
Like is that is that the kind of thing where you're like, I don't know where, where you would want to like, I know is that sort of thing where you would wanna, you wanna avoid that in the future?

16:54
If you, if you had like a kind of contract, you had like a discussion or an alternative opinion.

16:58
Whether someone could be like, hey, have you considered this?

17:02
and you know, maybe you would like, I guess find that earlier in the earlier in the chain of reasoning and be able to investigate it further I guess or well in that case for the example, it just, it kind of confirmed what we were feeling, but it was just kind of plainly written out for us and it wasn't contradictory.

17:21
It was just hey, it's too obvious here is this is an illustration of what we said.

17:26
So it wasn't really, it was more of a confirmation thing.

17:31
It probably would be nice to be able to integrate it to our talks, but it wasn't like ship we got it wrong, you know, it's more like hey, there you go.

17:41
It was, it was staring at us all along.

17:44
So so I don't know if it's the best example, but when he was describing this, this, this point as opposed to the example itself, I was thinking of something which I've kind of forgotten.

18:03
yeah, what was it you were saying about just this idea that like you know, it's basically what I thought again.

18:14
So I just, what I was saying last time was sometimes it's it's good to have time.

18:19
It's not about speeding up switch something you seem to have understood from other people as well.

18:24
It's not about maybe we're seeing time on some tasks but it's, you still want that time to digest the information to let it, you know rest.

18:34
And actually when you then look at it, it's a bit like a second opinion.

18:40
I was telling you about when I do it my on my own is that okay?

18:44
We have to deliver fast and all that kind of stuff.

18:46
But it's, if you give it a bit more time you you are yourself the second opinion.

18:53
Sometimes when you read what you've written, especially in terms of or even in terms of analysis, sometimes it's just all this data, all this information and then there's a sort of this aha moment, but something is matured a bit.

19:07
So you know, it's, you had time to, to maybe to understand things more more in depth but sometimes it's also about when you reread what you're, where you're at and you haven't had it and then then you read it again and you say that's not clear, you kind of your, your own, your your your own critique if you like about what you've done.

19:31
I suppose it's not as good as having a second opinion because that would be more immediate.

19:37
It would be a real second opinion and then you could disagree to, you could agree to disagree or refine your explanations.

19:45
So again, the second opinion thing is good Yeah, I suppose 11 other way, one other way we kind of found of I guess like phrasing that question really was like how do you know when you're done?

19:59
Like how do you know when, when you've got this report that you've like got everything and and is there any sense of anxiety that like you might have missed something ever?

20:13
No, I suppose that if you rewrote the report, you'd probably write it differently.

20:21
you'd write different right things, You write different things, especially if you're starting from from scratch right?

20:26
But I don't think necessarily the findings would be that different.

20:32
It's just that maybe the approach or the star or the, you know, there's nothing worse.

20:38
You've probably experienced maybe not so much quite young but it's all we've all had an experience of writing something and we haven't saved it and we lose it and it's just like terribly frustrating because you have to start over again and it's like you're trying to recapture what you thought had been was there, but actually you've kind of lost it.

20:57
So you've got to start from scratch.

21:00
Very frustrating actually.

21:01
It's a waste of time, but it's also the fact that you're never recapturing what you were quite pleased with and maybe at the end of the day it will be just as good because you started again apart from the time you've wasted.

21:12
But actually you you know, you've done a good job again, but I'm sure if you had the two copies that would be quite different in style, but not so much in terms of what we're looking at here, which is the, you know, the solidity of what you've outlined and found in there.

21:32
Well, I guess.

21:33
And how do you like what what what then like I guess determines the length of a project then?

21:39
Right, Because I guess if someone give you two weeks or they give you three months to perform it.

21:46
And so like is it is it is it just what what's modulating that?

21:50
Is it like just number of amount of data, amount of data that you can collect or because I suppose like presumably on a project and a longer project you spend more time analyzing.

22:02
So I guess it kind of comes back?

22:03
That's kind of when, when I'm trying to understand this question, like when is some, when it's finished, it's finished, it's finished when you you basically it's like you're pressing fruit and there's not much juice left.

22:15
So there's no point in going on and on about it.

22:17
You've done it.

22:18
Okay.

22:19
So you know, it's finished.

22:19
You've you've covered the data, you've said what you had to say and and what there was to say about the whole thing, you answered the questions objectives and you know, with with what you had, you know, that there's nothing else you could find in that data.

22:37
So I don't think, I don't think we're lacking in terms of having exploited, we might have overlooked, as I said earlier, a couple of points or decided to overlook.

22:46
But we again, it would be nice to maybe have these flashed at us and we say no, I know that, but you know, I'd rather not whatever.

22:54
But so I I don't think, I think we've exhausted the material the data so that the time it takes is is it's basically down to two things where the time the client gives, which is always they always want the results quickly take forever to commission something, but then they want it really fast.

23:13
So all the time you've wasted.

23:14
And then at the end.

23:16
So that's kind of silly because sometimes there's a risk there of indeed rushing through things and but then again, it depends what the output is.

23:24
I knew lots of different types of the report, I actually did it on sunday night, so what other things on.

23:33
So I thought, okay let's just do this, get rid of it.

23:36
It was from not a few notes but main mainly two groups.

23:40
and all they want this this kind of work with another agency, they watched the groups that are doing it over several markets.

23:47
They just want from me a digest of my understanding of things being french and they're not french and quite good format because you don't have to reread anything and it's a short it's a top line.

24:01
Okay, so I'm not gonna take long for that because I'm not gonna be working from notes, I'll be working from memory and a few notes I took during the sessions, I do take a few notes, so I've kind of got enough to go by and and it's it's a good it's a good use of my time and I think they get there's not much lost there, but there might be a few things that are overlooked because it's not it's not something I've really sifted through in detail, but some sometimes I'll be doing a report for, so that's only two groups that's pretty fast.

24:32
Sometimes you will be working on a much bigger project with lots of interviews or groups or maybe both.

24:38
And so there's much more data to go through.

24:41
So that will take longer and also probably something and I'll also get if this client for two groups that asked me for a full report and quotes obviously I would have taken much more time working on it with looking at transcripts or you know more detail than notes trying to find quotes trying to expand on different points.

25:04
This is more of a sort of key themes bullet point things that's pretty fast.

25:09
So that the again so I think probably a lot of quo people at the end of the, I think there's always someone writing a full report.

25:17
So but in my case there's because I work with agencies quite a bit I'm sometimes doing a sort of a pre report almost like or just a one market report.

25:30
There's another thing actually think about it.

25:32
Sometimes people are quite often working on multiple markets.

25:35
So you've got your your your market your data and you've also got to rely on other other sessions and there's maybe something to do there because well other people work differently.

25:48
It's difficult putting things into I think you lose a bit more and all the language issues as well.

25:58
The cultural issues you literally reading like their notes and their transcripts to make deductions from.

26:04
Where is it depends so many.

26:06
Sometimes you'll be asked to produce your own report for your market but someone at the end of the day is going to have to pull out a general international reports and that could include 2, 3 markets but it could include 20 markets.

26:23
So it's a massive thing.

26:25
Obviously if it's 20 markets that they're not gonna review each one in detail that we're going to try and point out the difference is this is what we're finding, blah blah blah ha.

26:35
But in Saudi Arabia and in Norway it's a bit different on this aspect for them.

26:40
So it's gonna be a bit, it can't be super detailed on every for every, it can't include, it's going to be also pointing out differences more than it's gonna be.

26:50
I'm trying to find common threads more than it's going to be about going in depth with each market, although there's probably a standalone report for each market as well.

27:00
But again as I said, it depends what what we're being asked for.

27:04
And and even some end clients will not literally want a huge report with, you know, dozens of slides and clients often want our quotes verbatim from.

27:19
So that's I think something that is that would help me that I just had an idea here is I I've got my nose or the transcripts or my memory and but if I got notes, I usually managed to pull out from them quotes but supposing you've got the idea would be that you have a transcript of every job you do and I think that's easier now with these automated transcripts and stuff, even if there are there are some language issues but on the basis of that works and you have all this data you can pull from what I would love.

27:55
And that's maybe a GPT chat type of thing.

27:57
Is just to say or chat is to say okay on this finding here, find me quotes that would that would match that at that point I've made or that section or so.

28:10
Either I just say, I don't know how I would have to enter the either I given what I've written and your system says, okay, I'll find quotes for that.

28:18
And obviously I want to quote with the identity, whatever I could enter the criteria like gender, age, a subgroup qualified.

28:27
We're doing people those are the owners of these are the contenders whatever or these are the people with such a frame of mind, whatever the creatives of this or that.

28:34
And and I'd like to be able to have that is takes a hell of a long time and and sometimes you've got a few that are obviously driving your analysis but you that's where you also get biases cause you got great quote of something and sometimes it's it's it could actually influence your perception because it's it's it sounds so clever.

28:59
It sounds like a good summary of what you've heard but it could also be masking other more subtle things.

29:06
And and I suppose sometimes you are driven by some of these notes that you've taken or quotes that you picked up.

29:13
You know, when you're reading your over highlighting things, this is a good thing.

29:17
He was a good train of thought and the guy he has expressed security and it's a nice thing and stuff and and and and that could sometimes bias you because you're going to overemphasize.

29:27
Yeah, I see that.

29:29
It's funny.

29:30
It's funny said actually started playing around with an idea late the other night.

29:34
that's sort of actually kind of sounds quite similar to that.

29:38
This is like one of the ideas we came up with like a sort of like a note pod where you can basically select some text and get it to suggest like like a comment you know, where I could do something like that, like find you more evidence or maybe present you with like an adversarial point of view.

29:57
So you could say like, you know, well I found something that doesn't agree with this or like I've I found more evidence of this and to then be able to like enter into a sort of chat style dialogue with it and then ultimately like suggest an edit and maybe a way to rewrite that to make it either like clearer or to incorporate new evidence or you know, to kind of push back on that or something.

30:22
Yeah, I think there's something where there's the system can either, you know, from an idea of what we do anyway, our approaches, we go from the, I don't think we go from intuitions to were more let's say academic in that way that we go from the the whatever people have said, what we've observed.

30:45
So facts, let's say or or testimonials or whatever.

30:50
And then we extract from that findings and high hypothesis and stuff if you like or we have some hypothesis hypothesis we wanna validate.

31:00
But in a sense, I don't go to in a group and my group was saying, you know, I wouldn't be able to ask your system approach a system by saying, okay, I've done these motorcycle groups you know, I think from what I heard, find the evidence on such and such a thing.

31:16
I'm going to draw a finding from, from the material and not the other way around if you like.

31:22
So that's maybe something I don't work in the sense of saying.

31:27
but I could actually have themes like, you know, commuting behavior or everyday usage, bicycle usage.

31:38
And then the thing brings me out but again, I'm not sure how the system works, but either brings me out all the across different groups, different different findings, you know, different material may be structured by, well here on the theme of yeah, financing, financing, your your your motorcycle when you buy it from you.

32:09
So and then it would pull out all the kind of themes or even it could It could put on one page on one screen like that, all the answers that we've had across different interviews or groups.

32:27
So it's kind of it's kind of speeding up the fact that rather than me, but if I have two groups quite easy, but if I have 12 or 20 interviews, I'm gonna have all these notes or transcripts, whatever and I'm gonna be going, okay, okay, on that point then I move on to the next one.

32:44
So I have all these piles of paper around me, if you like, and I'm comparing and say, ok, I'm going off.

32:49
So it's it's slow, it's not, but it's it's quite rigorous and it's, you know, and I get there, but sometimes you start with a couple, then you say, this is a bit the same and this is where you might risk overlooking something because you're, you know, after 20 you're getting a bit tired on this theme.

33:06
So you say, okay, I've understood it.

33:08
If you had something where your safety on this theme financing a motorcycle, it would bring out, let's say I have 20 interviews, it would bring out a page Crenshaw with all the comments.

33:21
So I don't know how how far your system goes in terms of analyzing and summarizing things, but at least if it lists everything for me.

33:30
And it's but it also mentions the sources, I e it's the guys who are the females that whatever.

33:37
I couldn't even I couldn't even tell it.

33:39
Listen, I want I want to see the difference between young and old.

33:42
Such an age, this is the cut the age group or or if I have in my sample, five subgroups I want to hear.

33:49
So, and they would give them each in a different color.

33:51
So I know that this color here is is the the what the people of such an age said this one is what the people, so and then I would have it all on one page or two and this is on this theme of financing a motorcycle.

34:04
I have everything that would speed up the process, but it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't actually feel like I'm cheating or cutting corners because I'm I'm isolating a theme, but I'm actually bringing, bringing it from different sources onto one document.

34:20
And yeah, I have everything on this now and I know just from looking at it whether it's these are the blue is the younger ones, the the pink is the ladies, that this is the new by the first time buyers.

34:33
And, and I, you know, and I can say, okay, now let's do it just by by age and re maps the whole thing.

34:40
And so I've got maybe I can have a print out of this or, and I have to look at two angles of looking at that.

34:46
And then I can look at, I can look at what basically would be refined notes as opposed to rough notes or you know or even extensive notes but there's the refining process is what is maybe something we could gain time on because it would be able to to to structure it.

35:05
I think I think I suppose like the I guess the idea of this would be like not not to completely rely on it so you would like obviously work the same way that you do at the moment and look through things and and find quotes and and write stuff out.

35:19
I suppose it's like I guess the idea of you kind of more sort of iterative in that like if you wanna if you wanna just test and see whether you squeeze all the juice out whether there's something else you might be able to say.

35:31
You could just kind of you know like have someone sort of give you like having someone give you a sort of a bit of feedback on it so they like you know just quickly like apply you know have someone sort of give it a once over compare it with the data and like see if there's something else there and if it's not useful then then you you know you move on and you kind of continue to work the same way you do but you have that additional level of like reach to just be able to like push really far into it and then just kind of service, any any other quotes you might have missed or you know, clarify, clarify point or get some sort of push back on it or I mean Jonathan, one thing alluding to that and other things that you've spoken about.

36:10
One thing that we were interested in was how these research processes differ when you're working on your own in an independent capacity versus in a larger agency or a sort of research institution or company or whatever.

36:24
Well I will work in a bigger institution but I know that it's the same as us except for bigger there's more people, but every person is accountable for one project if you like and someone is director and one is doing the groundwork but then the director will have his own views and basically the one leading something will will be able to kind of, you know, read what the other one is produced and say this is the second opinion or the experience opinion saying you've got to focus more on this, we need more than that or you know this is fine or whatever.

37:01
So I don't have that luxury but I know for working even bigger agencies use independence because they'll say okay we can handle this, can you handle this project and I even know a big agency, super big one in France where they all they have are directors and all the qualitative consultants are picked on a job basis and so they're assigned the study basically they're gonna do the whole thing.

37:27
They might and and and the director will just be sort of approving maybe enriching something or redirecting things but we'll let the so they'll be working pretty much on their own and they'll just be reporting to the director who will be able to critique and improve and or send out, you know, say we can you find out a bit more on this or whatever but we'll be driving in a way but maybe more like if you take the car analogy they'll they'll be using an independence chauffeurs to drive but they'll be in the back seat and say let's take that route here please.

38:04
I just prefer the view here, I think it would be shorter.

38:07
And the guy will say I think it's yeah, but I prefer there and because then you'll do that so but they'll still be just one driver really.

38:15
What might happen sometimes is that it's a huge load of field work.

38:19
I mean it's a big, you know there's loads of 2030 40 interviews groups and stuff all happening then of course it's different because you're going to split the job over two or three people and then these people are gonna do their own bits are going to have to debrief and you're gonna have to collect things.

38:37
you know from different sources and stuff.

38:38
So so that's that's a different set up when there's several working on the same project at the same level, but they're just splitting the workload and when it comes when you're when there's multiple people working on a single project, how how how do you guys come to a finished report?

38:56
Will you each work in your section and the director combines it together or I don't know, I think it's usually, you know, if you're doing it for director, he's going to be directing several projects but each one will be will have its its own main person carrying out the work the field work and analysis sometimes taking on someone else's interviews and transcripts and working from you know, but still on his own.

39:22
If there's several working Yeah, I mean that's basically it's always going to be but sometimes if it's gonna be something like that, what sometimes you'll do is you'll be producing a summary of each interview for instance.

39:44
Because typically there are that many groups, there's always many more interviews in the project if it's a big school project.

39:49
So we're gonna do is you're gonna say, okay well I'm not gonna go into death with each and every one of them, I'm going to produce a summary on the key points will be a 12 pager on on on on this this this interview, what happened, what was said, who's the interviewee blah blah blah.

40:04
So so then whoever is going to be working on the analysis will have you know one or two page summary maybe three's depending on what's covered.

40:14
But this sort of the key learnings from an hour to hour interview summarized and that will be the summary will be done by the person who did the interview and then you're working from that material but then you're kind of lacking the necessarily you're still lacking the verbatim and the quotes because you that's been summarized it's kind of been left out if you like.

40:35
So you still want to enrich the thing of quotes.

40:41
So I'm sorry I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to go.

40:44
But again I really find it interesting so you know if you want to talk again I'm happy to do so maybe next week if you want but hopefully I'm helping you.

40:54
But there I have I have couple things important things.

40:59
No problem.

41:00
Yeah we'll follow up I think yeah as I said we've got a few more calls scheduled.

41:04
We're also talking to some larger agencies like Ipsos and you govern stuff.

41:07
So trying to get some more a bit of a diverse view as well from some big organizations so it'd be great to catch up again next week and kind of tell you what we found.

41:15
Okay well with pleasure, good luck with it and certainly interesting things and it's helping me think of yeah it could be ways of maybe improving the way I'm working and saving time, of course, but something else okay, chat about, mate.
