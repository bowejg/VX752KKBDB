how are you?

0:00
Sorry about the other thought in my head, it was that, I think, I think you actually said it was going to be and then booked the one the week after.

0:11
It was, it was right.

0:16
That seems to be how things are going at the moment, christmas, isn't it?

0:22
Cool.

0:23
All right, well let's let's get to it.

0:25
I'm going to give you a quick background, so I'm interested in understanding more about the research consulting space, and specifically the kind of overall process and then a bit more of a drill down into like, techniques and potentially like, pain points game points within that.

0:47
, so what would be really useful for me, just like off the bat would be just to kind of brief overview about what you do, what sort of projects you work on and how you tend to go about them.

0:59
Yeah, okay, so there's two aspects to what I do.

1:04
So I do health coms work and I also do health research in primarily in the nonprofit sector is where I do my research show charities and nonprofit organizations focusing on health and social care.

1:22
And what the main type of research I do is qualitative.

1:28
so, working with people living with health conditions and their carers and families normally to find out their needs, and their experiences to help inform, inform a resource quite often or a service or I've done quite a lot of stuff looking at the reach of charities and helping them to try and reach more people.

1:53
So people experiencing health inequalities, from marginalized groups.

1:59
And my main kind of method is interviews, in depth interviews, but I've also, I also do focus groups as well.

2:09
A lot of that is online obviously nowadays, but I've started to do more face to face work again.

2:15
Okay.

2:16
And who, who are you typically contracted by?

2:22
Is it a business development team within a company or is it, could it be like a management consultancy for instance, or a strategy consultancy?

2:35
You know?

2:36
It's also mainly because I work with charities, it's mainly directly charity themselves, but I am on the books as associate for a few different kind of agencies.

2:51
one called Justice Studio and one called the Difference Collective.

2:56
so the Justice Studio work I've done has been mainly research work, but the difference collective tend to do more health coms work.

3:07
Health communications, Yeah, I guess like, drilling into that a bit more like could you describe perhaps using a case study that you're able to talk about what the different phases are of a project and like how how it comes about, I don't know.

3:29
So I presume some somebody reaches out by recommendation or something and they say, hey, we need some research work done, like what happens next.

3:40
Actually, I tend, I do quite of tenders for projects, so they might be advertised somewhere.

3:47
so I've just a few months ago I finished working on a project actually in the NHS, but I was employed by a charity within the NHS, so I saw the advert for that and I went through like an interview process and then eventually I was taken on as a research consultant and that was doing scoping out the needs of people at Barnet Hospital because they want to deliver some support services for them.

4:16
And typically I start off by doing desk research, so looking at existing report data, doing a literature search of my own, you know, looking at published research that exists, then I might do some kind of stakeholder mapping, seeing who's the important people I need to speak to.

4:41
and in that instance I spoke to clinicians, local community groups and then patients and carers.

4:49
so then there's kind of the research planning design phase where I design my research activities and the questions.

4:57
and then there's the actual kind of carrying out the research, so running the interviews, running the focus groups, having meetings with charities and clinicians, and then I have, like the data, the findings from all those interviews and I do an analysis and then I kind of draw out all the themes and write a report and a thing to say is a lot of the projects that I work on tend to be like, they need a really fast turnaround, People always seem to give like three months for a project, which is quite different from people working in an academic setting where you kind of quite often might have a year or something like that.

5:36
So everything I do has to be like pretty fast.

5:40
So that affects the way that I work and the way that I do analysis, I think.

5:45
Okay, how long is a typical project?

5:48
Like how long was that 1?

5:48
For instance, that was three months.

5:51
And then I just started another project for a big charity and that's three months to be a theme.

5:57
Yeah.

5:57
Okay, interesting.

5:58
And so from the point of like securing the tender, do you have like a kick off with the client?

6:07
Do you have a kind of, Okay, I've kind of missed out all the meetings and things.

6:12
Yeah.

6:14
And then like kind of catch up meetings throughout.

6:17
Yeah.

6:18
And how long how long is that initial desk research phase that you talked about normally has to be quite fast a couple of weeks.

6:31
And during during that time you're do you like what what sort where what sorts of things are you consuming in terms of your research materials?

6:42
So I tend to look at published kind of academic literature, so I might do some searches on, it depends on the topic, but Pub Med or Cochran or the library or what's it called?

6:58
The social science one.

6:59
I've forgotten the name S C.

7:01
I E.

7:01
Is a good one for a lot of my projects.

7:04
And then I'll look at Gray literature as well because that tends to be quite helpful for this sort of work.

7:09
So gray literature like so reports from that have been published by charities.

7:15
They're not like peer reviewed sort of think tanks like the King's Fund and Health Foundation.

7:21
Okay.

7:22
Yeah.

7:22
Yeah like more sort of yeah I know the ones you mean there more like what they called white papers rather than kind of peer reviewed academic things put out through universities.

7:38
Okay so a couple of weeks of that and then then what happens next?

7:43
You go into a kind of the data collection phase I guess so yeah.

7:48
Then it would be kind of designing the research, they're designing the research tools or basically that means coming up the questions I'm gonna ask people all the activities I might do.

8:00
I try to do more kind of creative activities and focus groups designing all of that.

8:08
And then some of the practical stuff like consent forms and things have to, this is sensitive information.

8:15
I've heard that actually from somebody else is like GDP are a big concern.

8:19
Does that mean that you have to like destroy everything after I destroy everything and make sure everything anonymized when they write up reports, I'll basically change people's names or take people's names out and personal details and then all the different organizations have normally have their own data protection policy as well.

8:40
So I have to work with them to make sure my consent forms and things kind of match up.

8:44
Do you write your own consent forms?

8:46
I've got templates that I use quite often because also I try to make them very accessible because they can be quite, because I'm often working with people who have low literacy levels and make sure they're very clear, are they?

9:00
Do you get those from like a website or something?

9:02
Like is it like I kind of designed my own but at some point I must have seen someone.

9:10
Yeah, kind of seen some that I've copied and adapted I think.

9:13
Yeah.

9:14
Okay.

9:16
All right.

9:17
And then, and then like how, how many, how many weeks of the project is that sort of design and then conducting of the research, the sort of experiments if you will take.

9:30
Yeah, so only a month.

9:34
What I often am involved in as well as recruiting people for the research because that's something that often these organizations find quite difficult.

9:44
So I do a lot of that and that can take the longest amount of time actually if it's groups, you know, that are not often involved in research work.

9:55
Yeah, yeah, recruiting people for research is very difficult and they don't, I mean the projects I've started working on now, they've actually got a really good budget, which is quite rare in the charity sector.

10:12
Haven't often like allocated enough budget or time, that type of thing.

10:18
It's a lot of like calling on people that I know in my networks and social media, how do you recruit people of interest?

10:29
Often go through like intermediaries?

10:32
So the project I worked on, I worked on another project for a charity and I worked with social prescribers in the area I live in we work with GP surgeries and they're like in touch with people that you know experiencing health inequalities quite a lot.

10:49
And then I also work with local community groups as a south asian community group and older persons community group.

10:58
and then for the hospital project they have a patient experienced team.

11:03
So we tried to recruit patients via them actually proved quite difficult.

11:07
So I did quite a lot of stuff like actually just kind of being on the wards and speaking to people in the world.

11:14
social media can be helpful depending on your audience but yeah, you get quite as more and more common to get people that are like scammers social media, you've got to be careful of that.

11:29
Yeah, interesting.

11:30
Yeah.

11:33
Okay.

11:33
Got it.

11:34
And then it's okay, so the data collection we think about about a month and then like do you, is it quite like is it quite iterative and agile or is it more sort of regimented book work collect?

11:50
No iterative and agile for the type of things that I work on.

11:55
Yeah and what and so do you what are you, what are you collecting all of this work into?

12:06
Is there like a deck or something that you work on the start or do you mean in terms of a report or what what's the what's the what's the sort of it's like what's the sort of rolling piece of work that is so I mean I can tell you how I collect the data.

12:31
So I I used the software grain quite a lot.

12:38
So say I'm doing like video interviews or even if I record audio so I record everything basically.

12:46
And then I can use grain to transcribe it all and also you can use it to create little sort of audio or video snippets that you can tag.

12:58
But what I tend to I don't have any software that I use.

13:02
So like a lot of qualitative researchers would use in vivo or something like that.

13:07
So I tend to use an Excel to put it all in and I might have like my key questions or key themes in the Excel spreadsheet and then I can kind of see what the key points emerging and then what like an end project ends kind of product tends to vary.

13:28
So some people want like a detailed report and other people just want a slide deck kind of teams and a presentation often.

13:37
Yeah.

13:38
Normally have to do a presentation to explain it all.

13:44
That makes sense.

13:45
And do you how much do you pay for grain?

13:51
Out of interest?

13:52
I can't remember.

14:00
Got it.

14:00
And do you work with other people normally on these projects quite often?

14:04
Yeah the hospital one, it was just me on my own.

14:06
But for the bowel cancer charity, when I'm working with another researcher when it's like a quick turnaround, it's helpful to other people.

14:17
They they employed in the same capacity or they kind of doing something else like handling the recruitment or like how do you tend to divide it up?

14:25
This one?

14:26
We're dividing it up.

14:27
She's doing more kind of data collection data analysis because I don't really do any quantitative research right?

14:35
She's initially looking at the charity has got a lot of data about their services and she's been looking at all of that.

14:43
Okay.

14:43
Yeah.

14:45
Playing 12 different strengths.

14:47
Yeah that makes sense.

14:48
She's a social researcher and she's coming through academia so she's had a different route in.

14:55
Okay.

14:59
Weird weird question.

15:01
What's the worst project you've worked on?

15:05
Whatever.

15:08
Yeah.

15:09
Like what was one where you were like, I don't know like you know kind of this I really don't wanna do it anymore like you know like what was the kind of worked on one?

15:21
Just it's just because it was so depressing the topic.

15:24
It was for a charity, a tiny charity that supported Children and families who have like the most awful progressive neurological disease you've ever heard of.

15:37
Also the charity was founded by people that had lost their Children to it.

15:42
So it was just really depressing and in the end I did a lot of the desk research and then I sort of farmed out the qualitative research to someone else you could handle it because yeah, I think it was just a tricky organization to work with because of their like personal attachment to the cause.

16:01
Okay, that makes sense.

16:02
And I suppose like, okay, and and like I suppose human factors aside a little bit like have there been anywhere like, I don't know, they haven't like I don't know they've run over time or budget or you've had like a scope creep or like stuff like that that's quite common.

16:26
I won't say the name of the organization, but they're not a charity.

16:28
They're like a sort of a community interest company that and they get some funding from the government and that was one where they like they told me they could do all the recruitment and they couldn't and I ended up having to do all of the recruitment and I think I just really over delivered for them for the money and the time like in hindsight, I probably wouldn't do that all again.

16:50
What's the knock on effect there?

16:52
Like how does that affect your bottom line?

16:55
I didn't have any money.

17:00
And also yeah, they were really, really slow to pay me.

17:03
So I think there was a couple of months I had no income because, and I know another researcher who worked with them who he put his foot down more and they basically fell out with the company because he was like I can't do this for that money.

17:19
And then yeah he was having a lot of problems getting paid by them is a bit of a tricky one because like on paper they seem like a great company.

17:28
And all the people that work there were really nice like kind of young people.

17:31
But yeah there's something not quite right but there is there like a do you do you ever allow or go a bit further or allow the project to become unprofitable?

17:43
Perhaps in order to maintain a relationship with the client, like somebody gives you a lot of work and you're like okay I'll do it for these guys because I want, you know there's more coming.

17:55
Yeah, probably.

17:56
And also I think there's a tricky thing of like working in the charity sector because my background is I come from the charity sector as like a permanent employee.

18:05
So I've seen like two sides of the coin.

18:08
So yeah there is that feeling of maybe deliver a bit too much because it's for a good cause perhaps and yeah and also to kind of maintain relationships probably.

18:18
So that that company I spoke about one where you know I was kind of a bit out of pocket, they still want me to do work for them.

18:27
So I have like maintained a good relationship with them.

18:30
This sort of like is it?

18:31
Yeah.

18:34
Yeah, it's an interesting one Okay questions what questions like what's the project that went like seriously?

18:50
Well for you, what was one way you felt like you really crushed it and we did one for a charity that was lymphoma charity and that was about health inequalities and kind of like figuring out their reach and it was me and two other researchers and we yeah, we really delivered really well, we help them reach loads of people with a survey.

19:14
We found really good insight and that kind of changed what they do as a charity and I think it was nice because I was working with two other people as well.

19:23
We all have different strengths, that kind of team working.

19:28
Yeah.

19:29
Yeah, it's interesting.

19:31
I was going to a few consults researches and its theme.

19:36
I think people like to see the impact and change from their work, rewarding thing, I think especially if you're not in academia because I think one of the frustrations with academia is you don't often see an impact especially if you do social research, you can imagine Got it and I guess Okay, so alright, given that like, okay, so I suppose like given it sounds like there are kind of time constraints at least when you work on these things, financial implications when those aren't there perhaps or diplomatic ones with clients who may be providing you work in the future.

20:18
how how how do you like value your your productivity.

20:22
Like do you are you quite willing to try things out or like pay for tools or other things to kind of speed that up or?

20:29
Yeah, so like I paid for the grain tool because someone recommended that to me.

20:33
So yeah, in the past few years I've invested a lot more in my business.

20:37
Like when I see when I'm doing my tax returns and stuff now I can see that I've paid for more tools to make my business easier.

20:44
So things like grain I do some social media stuff so I've got a few social media scheduling tools.

20:51
I've got canvas a and stuff like that now and I have a proper operations budget so I'm a bit more control in control in the last couple of years.

21:01
Okay, interesting.

21:05
Got it.

21:06
Yeah.

21:07
Have you ever like hired like an intern or a research assistant or anyone to help you?

21:11
Yeah.

21:12
So I have a social media assistant who has my social media for my business.

21:19
I kind of planet and she now she writes some of it and she sort of puts it all together and then also for six months I had I had an assistant through the kickstart scheme which is a government that was a bit of a disaster.

21:37
She was a lovely person but she had it turned out she had a kind of mental health problems.

21:43
So I spent a lot of time helping her supporting her rather than like I don't know if I got that much out of it.

21:52
I was hoping it would be someone I could train, help me do research and things but it just turned out not to be appropriate.

21:58
What did you want?

21:58
What was the, what did you want to do?

22:00
I guess that was what was exciting about having, what kind of tasks are you going to get?

22:07
It was more like business tasks like helping with my website, helping social media, helping me.

22:13
I have a newsletter right as part of my business, she did do that.

22:17
But then I was hoping I could train her and she could assist with some bits of research.

22:23
Like if I was running a focus group she could come with me or when she got more confident she could maybe do some interviews of data analysis.

22:31
But it just turned out that she wasn't really able to do that.

22:36
Interesting.

22:38
Well thank you that I guess there's like a bit more context than what we're doing.

22:44
So I don't know you had a chance to check out our website but we basically built a tool for academics and researchers to summarize papers and get their literature reviews done faster and we're working on a new product now which we want to target more at the professional sector.

23:02
Either in management strategy consulting or quell research.

23:07
Somewhere there's a lot of like kind of qualitative data handling in the form of like you know reading reports or decks or producing reports or decks or having phone calls with like either key opinion leaders or focus groups or or customers for instance to to gather data.

23:26
And the product that we're working on is basically like a it's basically a sort of chat bot into which you can upload all of your documents, like your transcripts, Pds, resources etcetera and then kind of just have a sort of chat conversation with and using that excise kind of insights and various things so you can ask it questions and it will like give you answers with references back to where they came from.

23:57
If you're trying to think of the best way to like fraser a slide or something you can ask it like how would you express this kind of give you some suggestions?

24:05
So it's sort of like having a research assistant I guess.

24:11
And so we're trying to we're just trying to understand like a couple of things really like we feel like it's, you know, it's an interesting proposition.

24:18
Obviously it all depends on how well it works.

24:22
And I guess what we're trying to understand is like what are what's the best way to like express this in a in terms of pain points that's going to resonate the most with people doing those sorts of jobs and I guess what's the best way to reach them as well?

24:38
Yeah, it's really interesting.

24:41
I mean something I sometimes find really difficult is the bit where you have to pull everything together.

24:46
Is that the kind of thing that could help?

24:48
So say I've got like reports, I've got transcripts, I've got, you know, all these different ideas.

24:54
Yeah.

24:55
Yeah, I can show you like a kind of a quick sort of like a screenshot of that work.

25:01
It is is an academic context, this particular one, but this is kind of roughly roughly how it sort of works.

25:08
So you know, you basically have like a sort of if I can hide this over here on the left we have like a document.

25:20
and in the sort of final version we want people to be able to upload many documents as well so you can set them and they could be pds, academic papers, transcripts, research reports, that kind of thing.

25:32
And then here on the right you would have this sort of chatbots and you can ask it questions and it will give you like referenced answers to kind of help answer these questions.

25:43
And if you click on any of the references, it'll like show you where I got that from.

25:47
So you can kind of check its its logic or whatever and that and then on top of that as well it will be able to like also write, write text for you.

25:57
So if you if you give it a paragraph of text and say, hey can you turn this into a punchy like slide deck or something or a slide for a deck or something?

26:06
It would be able to do that too.

26:10
Yeah, because making the power point slides takes me asia sometimes thinking of the right way to express things.

26:16
I mean I have an advantage because I did columns as well for a living.

26:20
So sometimes yeah, that is time consuming.

26:25
Yeah.

26:25
Do you use any like ai writing tools or anything at the moment?

26:30
No, no, I know there's a lot of chat about them.

26:33
Yeah, copywriters scared.

26:36
Yeah.

26:38
Yeah, I think they're interesting.

26:40
I our thesis really is just that like a lot of the way a lot of them work is they just they just have a purely just generate things from the data that they're trained on and we kind of think that you know that human guided originality and analysis is important.

27:00
Things work well as like a sparring partner but not a replacement.

27:03
Yeah, definitely.

27:06
Yeah, I guess I don't know issue right now is just like obviously it's still in development, we're just trying to figure out precisely like what the right messaging and targeting is and we can kind of reach people best.

27:20
Yeah, if I can help you.

27:24
Yeah, so you're thinking more for academics but you're thinking about consultants.

27:29
So this particular example is for an academic but we want to target it at professionals.

27:34
So quote researchers, consultants, that kind of thing.

27:39
So you know if you had a bunch of transcripts for interviews you could kind of asking questions like I don't know what what did people think about, you know, this issue or that issue and it would kind of try and give you answers based on the stuff that you uploaded.

27:50
Yeah.

27:52
I mean a market research, this is probably another good audience because I mean I work in a shared office and I have had a colleague here who does market research and he's a similar thing to me is he needs to get everything done really quickly, fast turnaround.

28:10
Like he might do loads of interviews one week and then the next week he has to produce a deck, he's gone traveling now because otherwise I would recommend you speak to him.

28:19
But yeah, I think that type of thing would be helpful.

28:23
We've got loads of transcripts or lots of reports.

28:27
Can you think of a way because I feel like there's a couple of like phases of a typical project I'd say in in quote and management to where like you know there's kind of like you know there's sort of Discovery, there's a kind of problem, the discovery phase problem definition, you know, collection of data analysis and then sort of delivery.

28:51
And within that there are lots of like, you know sometimes and various things like, can you, is there, I was trying to think about this earlier and if you haven't had any thoughts on this, I'm trying to kind of think about, you know, I think the the areas in which we could help are basically in analysis like transcription, content creation for the decks, that sort of thing.

29:13
What I'm trying to do is sort of quantify like a time saving that we can bring people or like an amount of time saved like do you have a rough idea or I don't know, you know, I guess that's kind of what I was interested really in like the breakdown of how much time you're spending phases like I suppose what I don't know, maybe an approach that might be to take to kind of figure that out.

29:35
Do I have an idea of the times roughly that Yeah, yeah, sort of I guess a breakdown of how you're spending your time right now, Maybe that might No, I'm really terrible knowing what I mean.

29:49
I do project plan.

29:51
So say for the bowel cancer thing I'm working at the moment, I've done a project plan that's allocated days different tasks.

30:00
I can send you that with like the detail taken out.

30:03
That would be that would be quite helpful.

30:05
Like that's a good idea at the time sheet maybe because I suppose that shows you like a deconstruction activities.

30:11
So it's basically a spreadsheet.

30:15
So it's like a forward planning document.

30:18
Time sheet.

30:19
I'm not very good at tracking my time for research projects.

30:22
I track it a lot for comms projects because I quite often have to do time sheets for those.

30:27
I use like toggle for that sort of thing.

30:31
A it's a timer that tells you how long you're working on different things.

30:43
Yeah, if you had a forward planning document just showing our breakdown and like I guess the phases of how it developed, that would be extremely helpful.

30:52
I don't mind, I'll take out some of the details.

30:57
That will be perfect, brilliant.

31:00
Well look, thank you, thank you so much for this, appreciate it.

31:04
Be interested in kind of hearing about how it's going.

31:08
It does seem like it would be helpful.

31:10
